The pollen count has reached 41,224 particles per cubic metre (PPM) in H-8.
The hot, dry and windy conditions result in higher pollen and mold concentrations, and increased allergy symptoms because pollens are microscopic particles and easily spread over great distances by wind.
On the other hand, the Met Office has predicted that the hot and dry weather conditions will prevail till the end of the current month.
It also predicted below normal precipitation over most parts of the country, including northern Punjab and Islamabad, in April and May.
Extremely high concentrations of pollen are observed in March and April that start to fade off in May and June. However, there is a pollen concentration in the monsoon season too in the federal capital.
The pollen grains are the male tiny particles which are released from trees, weeds and grasses. The pollen grains function is to fertilise other parts of plants but many never reach their targets and remain suspended in the atmosphere.
Most species of pollen have some level of allergenicity but not all of them cause sensitivities for humans.
Islamabad is among the cities with the highest pollen counts in the world because of the population of paper mulberry trees.
The pollen count from the paper mulberry and other sources, including pines, grasses, flowers and some fungi, was less than 7,000 PPM in F-10 while in E-8 and G-6 it was recorded at 8,184 and 7,942, respectively.

6,IHC hints at imposing fine on PTI's Kanwal Shauzab for baseless litigation,Shauzab had a brawl with her neighbours over the beautification of a nullah adjacent to her house in Islamabad's F-11.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has hinted imposing a fine on a PTI lawmaker under the Cost of Litigation Act for baseless litigation after she challenged the order of a local court for registration of an FIR against her for allegedly manhandling an elderly couple. 
The court was hearing a petition filed by Member National Assembly (MNA) Kanwal Shauzab. Ms Shauzab had a brawl with Mohammad Abdul Rehman and his wife Fatima Rehman over the beautification of a nullah adjacent to her house in F-11. 
The lawmaker’s husband lodged a complaint against them with the cybercrime wing of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for making a video of the beautification work and uploading it on social media. 
The neighbours, on the other hand, filed a complaint in the local police, stating Ms Shauzab and her security guard manhandled them. 
After the police did not register the FIR, the additional district and sessions judge ordered the registration of the case which Ms Shauzab challenged in the IHC.  
During the hearing, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah observed that the petition appeared to be a classic example of grave abuse of power by the FIA. 
The dispute between Ms Shauzab and her neighbours began when the Capital Development Authority and the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad started cleaning the area and initiating construction work on a rainwater ravine after the lawmaker shifted to her house at F-11. 
After perusal of the record, the court noted that “there was admittedly an extraordinary activity by the CDA and the MCI when the MNA moved to her house in F-11.  
“Both the public bodies started activities that also involved expense from the public exchequer. There was significant activity and construction work to make the rainwater ravine and the area around the house more presentable.” 
The court expressed displeasure over the conduct of the MNA and noted: “It appeared that she did not realise that she was a public officeholder and not an ordinary citizen.” 
The court order stated that “in order to ensure fairness, transparency and to meet the ends of justice, the court appoints Asad Umer, minister for planning, and Senator Syed Ali Zafar advocate as amici curiae to assist the court. They shall also assist the court as to why the application filed by Ms Shauzab may not be allowed by ordering payment of exemplary costs to the two senior citizens who were subjected to abuse of powers by the FIA.”  
The investigating officer and the director cybercrime FIA were also put on notice to explain why they may also not be ordered to pay exemplary costs. 
The court put the elderly neighbours of the lawmaker on notice telling them that they “will be at liberty to file their affidavit of costs under the Cost of Litigation Act 2017.”

Mohammad Anwar, a resident of Misrial Road, said water shortage had created problems for the residents as they had to pay Rs1,700 to Rs2,000 to private tankers while supply from Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) had not improved in the last three years.  
Abdullah Khan, of Naseerabad, said that the civic body had failed to solve the water shortage problem.
Sajid Mehmood, a resident of Lal Kurti, said Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) had also failed to supply water regularly. 
Abdul Hameed, of Kamalabad, said that with the start of the hot weather, people faced water shortage. He said the civic body was of the view that it was getting less water from Khanpur Dam.  
When contacted, CCB’s elected member Raja Irfan Imtiaz said there were a few tubewells in the area and the residents mostly depended on water supply from Khanpur Dam.  
However, he said RCB was providing less water to the CCB which created problems in the area.
“According to the ratio, RCB has to provide four million gallon daily (MGD) water to Chaklala but it is providing only two MGD which is less than the requirement,” he said.  
He said water shortage was the main issue in the cantonment area and for the last over three years “we have been raising the issue with the federal government but to no avail.”

13,Legislative changes required before allowing RCB to regulate ‘H’ sectors: CDA,"With exclusion of H-13, H-14 and H-15, Islamabad’s area will reduce from 906.5 sq km to about 894 sq km...","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has informed the federal government that before allowing the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) to regulate three ‘H’ series sectors of Islamabad, necessary legislative changes were required as the issue of overlapping boundaries between the civic agencies was still undecided.
Sources said that last week during a meeting held at the Cabinet Division, officials of the CDA law wing had said that without legislative changes the RCB could not operate in CDA’s sectors. It was discussed that the RCB wanted to take over the three sectors only to the extent of imposing its regulations, provision of municipal services and tax collection and the sectors will remain part of Islamabad.
“We shared our view point in detail. It was discussed that the CDA could be asked for its comments in writing for moving ahead,” a CDA source said.
They said participants of the meeting were told that without making changes to the CDA Ordinance 1960 and the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital of the Republic Ordinance 1963, the CDA could not exclude the sectors from Islamabad’s jurisdiction.

With exclusion of H-13, H-14 and H-15, Islamabad’s area will reduce from 906.5 sq km to about 894 sq km

Over the years, the issue of overlapping boundaries has been taken up in a series of meetings in which the RCB claimed ownership on 2,509 acres in various sectors and stated that survey sheets for 1964, 1977, 1980 and 1985 held with RCB showed that these areas should be in RCB’s jurisdiction.
At a meeting held last year, the CDA and RCB in principle had agreed that the former will back off from its claim of ownership on land in Islamabad and in lieu of this three un-acquired sectors - H-13, H-14 and H-15 - will be excluded from the capital’s boundaries.
An official of the CDA law wing said last year the RCB through the Ministry of Defence had also moved a summary to the federal government, asking to make necessary changes to the law for excluding the three sectors from the jurisdiction of Islamabad.
The federal government through the Ministry of Interior then sought comments from the CDA.
In response, the CDA did not oppose the move but stated that legislation was required for this purpose.
The CDA’s summary dated June 14, 2021, stated: “Sector of G-13, G-14, I-14 and I-12 are not recommended for exclusion (from Islamabad’s limit) as the same has already been acquired and developed by FGEHA/CDA as per master plan of Islamabad.
“Sector H-13, H-14 and H-15 are yet to be acquired and developed by CDA as per the master plan of Islamabad and CDA Ordinance 1960 for institutional use. With the change of jurisdiction of these sectors from Islamabad to RCB, the area of the capital will reduce from 906.5 sq km to about 894 sq km, which require legislative changes.”
Sources said in the latest meeting, RCB officials said instead of excluding the three sectors from Islamabad’s jurisdiction, the RCB should be allowed to regulate and provide municipal services besides carrying out tax collection in them.
Besides overlapping of boundaries, the RCB had also been claiming that it had some portion of land in G-13, G-14, I-14, I-12 and in some H-series sectors.
According to RCB’s claim, it has 85 acres in G-13, 145 acres in G-14, 677 acres in 1-12, 78 acres in I-14, 676 acres in H-13 and 1,395 acres in H-14 and H-15. However, last year, it was decided that RCB would withdraw its claim in the four sectors and in lieu will get control in three un-acquired H-series sectors.
Out of them, H-13 is dotted with hundreds of unplanned and unregulated buildings as the CDA never made any serious attempts to impose its regulations there.
