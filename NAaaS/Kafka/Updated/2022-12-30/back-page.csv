0,NSC moot called to mull strategy for counter-terrorism,The committee will meet today; army to seek ‘political ownership’ of any new operation.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Security Committee will meet on Friday (today) to review counter-terrorism preparedness and chalk out a strategy in the wake of rising terrorist attacks, an official told Dawn.
The decision to convene the meeting of the NSC — the principal decision-making forum on foreign policy and national security — was taken in a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir on Thursday.
The meeting between the two took place a day after the corps commanders’ conference at the General Headquarters where the surge in terrorism incidents dominated the agenda.
An important element of the military’s statement issued after the corps commanders’ conference was that the terrorist threat would be eliminated “as per the aspirations of the people of Pakistan”.

Army to seek ‘political ownership’ of any new operation

This showed that the army, with its readiness to act against terrorist groups, needed political ownership of any new counter-terrorism operation that may be launched.
 
 

The coalition government, which has so far shied away from tough decisions, was, meanwhile, finding it difficult to commit to any large-scale kinetic operation amidst economic turmoil and ahead of impending elections next year.
However, it is expected that the military’s advice would ultimately prevail in light of the urgency of the situation.
Over the past few months, the law and order situation in the country has worsened, with terrorist groups like the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the militant Islamic State group, and Gul Bahadur Group executing attacks with near impunity across the country.
Insurgents in Balochistan have also stepped up their violent activities and formalised a nexus with the TTP.
The incident at the Khyber-Pakh­tunkhwa police’s Counter-Terrorism Dep­art­ment interrogation centre in Bannu and the botched suicide bombing attempt in Islamabad not only set off alarm bells in the power corridors but also left several countries worried about the security of their nationals.
The US, UK, Australia and Saudi Arabia have issued advisories, asking their nationals to restrict movements in Pakistan and avoid non-essential trips.
The other issue the NSC will deliberate upon, according to a source, is the rise in cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
The Afghan Taliban have long seen Pakistan as their bridge to the international community, but they aren’t ready to relent on the traditional Afghan position on the nearly 2600-km-long border separating the two countries.
 
 

These differences in the status of the border have often led to military skirmishes with loss of lives on both sides.
Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, at the weekly media briefing on Thursday, talked about the border incidents with Afghanistan.
“We are engaged with Afghan authorities on issues related to security and border management. Afghanistan has given certain assurances and we hope the promises made will be honoured,” she said without telling what assurances had been extended by Taliban authorities.
Meanwhile, on the advisories issued by some of the foreign missions, the spokesperson reassured that Pakistani security agencies were “fully capable of and prepared” to protect their citizens as well as foreign nationals residing here.
“We attach the highest importance to the safety and security of all foreign diplomatic missions in Islamabad, and have assured them of our full support and cooperation,” she maintained, adding those trying to disrupt peace in the country “would be strictly dealt with by our law enforcement authorities”.

1,Practical engagement with Kabul continues: FO,FO also expresses disappointment over the Afghan government’s decision about women’s education.,"ISLAMABAD: The For­eign Office has said that Pakistan has pursued continuous and practical engag­ement with the interim Afghan government since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul on Aug 15, 2021.
Addressing a weekly briefing on Thursday, FO Spoke­sperson Mumtaz Zehra Baloch said that during the outgoing year Pakistan was involved in multilateral dipl­omacy, both in an individual capacity and as a member of international groupings.
Regarding Afghanistan, she expressed disappointment over the interim government’s decision about women’s education and their participation in public life.
Talking about Islamabad’s engagement with Kabul, she mentioned the meeting between Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir on the sidelines of the SCO-CFM in Tashkent, as well as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar’s visit to Kabul last month.
Referring to an attack on Pakistan’s head of mission in Kabul, the spokesperson said the security of Pakistan’s diplomats and missions in Afgh­anistan had been stepped up.
About India, Ms Baloch said Pakistan had maintained that bilateral relations could not fully normalise until the resolution of outstanding disputes, especially the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
She said that removal of Pakistan from the grey list of FATF and the establishment of Loss and Damage Fund at COP27, are among the major outcomes of Islamabad’s dip­lo­macy throughout 2022.

2,200 tourists trapped in heavy AJK snowfall evacuated,"Rescue teams evacuate stranded tourists to safety and soon they will be brought back to Muzaffarabad, says commissioner.","MUZAFFARABAD: At least 200 tourists, including women and children, were safely evacuated from a high altitude tourist resort on the outskirts of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital on Thursday evening after they were stuck in the snow there, an official said. 
Divisional commissioner Masoodur Rehman told Dawn that since the Met office had predicted rain and snow on Thursday, hundreds of people had flocked to the 9,300-foot high Pir Chinasi resort to enjoy the season’s first snowfall. 
However, when the snowfall became intense, most of them were unable to go back to Muzaffarabad through the snow-bound road and consequently got stuck up there, he said. 
The commissioner said that after some local tourists alerted Muzaffarabad-based media persons and police about the situation, rescue teams were rushed to the area in 4x4 vehicles to evacuate the stranded tourists to safety. 
It takes motorists less than an hour from Muzaffarabad to reach Pir Chinasi, located at a distance of 34 kilometres, in their normal 4x2 vehicles. 
Mr Rehman said the teams evacuated the stranded tourists in their 4x4 vehicles to a state-run guesthouse in Sarran, five kilometres short of Pir Chinasi at an altitude of 7,540 feet, in the first leg of the rescue operation. From Sarran, all of them were brought to Muzaffarabad afterwards, he said. 
The commissioner said that 30 drivers had been provided safe accommodation in Sarran rest house for the night, so that they could drive back their stuck-up vehicles in Pir Chinasi on Friday when the weather is predicted to be clear. 
Mr Rehman said the heavy snowfall had also struck other high altitude areas, but no such complaint was received from anywhere else.

3,Russia hits Ukraine with barrage of missiles,Kyiv claims it shot down 54 of 69 missiles launched by Moscow,"KYIV: Russia fired scores of missiles into Ukraine on Thursday, targeting the capital Kyiv and other cities, including Lviv and Odesa in the west, in one of its largest aerial bombardments that sent people rushing to shelters and knocked out power. 
“Senseless barbarism. These are the only words that come to mind seeing Russia launch another missile barrage at peaceful Ukrainian cities ahead of New Year,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. 
Ukraine’s military said it had shot down 54 missiles out of 69 launched by Russia in an assault that began at 7am local time. Air raid sirens rang out across Ukraine and in Kyiv sounded for five hours — one of the longest alarms of the war. Officials had earlier said more than 120 missiles were fired into Ukraine during the attack. 
In Kyiv, footage showed a team of emergency workers poring through the smouldering wreckage of residential houses destroyed by a blast and smoke trails of missiles lingering in the sky over the capital. 

Kyiv claims it shot down 54 of 69 missiles launched by Moscow

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, fire fighters worked to extinguish a large blaze at an electricity station. 
In the southern central city of Zaporizhzhia, houses were damaged and a missile left a huge crater. Ukraine’s military said Russia had launched air and sea-based cruise missiles, anti-aircraft guided missiles and S-300 ADMS at energy infrastructure facilities in eastern, central, western and southern regions. The attacks followed an overnight assault by ‘kamikaze’ drones. 
Waves of Russian air strikes in recent months targeting energy infrastructure have left millions without power and heating in often freezing temperatures. “The enemy placed a high stake on this attack, preparing for it for two weeks. Ukrainian air defence forces demonstrated an incredible level of skill and efficiency,” said Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal on the Telegram messaging app. 
“At the same time, there were hits and damage, in particular to energy facilities. In some areas, emergency shutdowns may be applied to avoid accidents in the networks. Our power engineers are already working to repair everything,” he added. 
The latest blitz came hard on the heels of the Kremlin’s rejection of a Ukrainian peace plan, insisting that Kyiv must accept Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. 
Air defences 
Kyiv authorities said two private houses in Darnytskyi district were damaged by the fragments of downed missiles and a business and a playground were also damaged. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said 16 missiles were shot down and three people injured in the attacks. 
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said on Telegram that 90 per cent of his city near the Polish border was without electricity. The missiles damaged an energy infrastructure unit. 
In the southwestern Odesa region, the fragments of one missile hit a residential building, though no casualties were reported, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Belarus’ state-run BelTA news agency reported that a Ukrainian S-300 missile had fallen onto the territory of Belarus on Thursday and published a photo of what it said were parts of it lying in an empty field. 
Minsk was investigating whether its air defence systems had shot down the rocket or it was a misfire. The incident happened around the time Russia was firing missiles at Ukraine.
