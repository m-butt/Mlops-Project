0,Over 200 medics in ex-Fata unpaid for four months,Officials insist funds not available to pay salary,"PESHAWAR: More than 225 doctors, including medical officers, emergency medical officers and specialists, appointed by the government to improve patient care in the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), haven’t been paid salary for four months with authorities blaming it on a lack of funds.
Officials told Dawn that those medics were recruited in April 2021 under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP) to cater to the needs of the people in tribal districts.
They said the AIP was approved by the federal cabinet to employ staff members for many departments in the region after the tribal region’s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The officials said the government had sanctioned 300 positions of medical officers with a monthly package of Rs200,000.

Officials insist funds not available to pay salary

They said 283 appointments were made but the doctors either resigned or were terminated for legal reasons bringing the tally down to 172.
The officials said the government had also announced 219 positions of emergency medical officers (EMO) with a monthly salary of Rs300,000, but the department didn’t find the doctors in required number and filled 36 posts only.
They said under the same programme, 100 posts of medical specialists were approved against the monthly payment of Rs450,000, but only 18 of them were filled.
The officials said for the last five months, the appointees hadn’t been paid salary due to the unavailability of funds with the provincial government.
They said the programme was meant to ensure the presence of doctors in tribal districts, where absenteeism was rife in health centres with the health department receiving scores of complaints about it from residents as well as local authorities.
The officials said most doctors opted for the programme jobs due to fat salaries.
They said the initiative led to the improvement of the healthcare system in the tribal region but things were no more working due to the denial of salaries to doctors.
The officials said the doctors had been paid late since their appointment due to the lengthy process of the verification of their educational documents by the relevant boards of intermediate and secondary education, Khyber Medical University, and Pakistan Medical Commission.
They said funds were not available to pay those appointees.
Women medical officers insisted that they’re the most affected by delayed payments as their families depended on their salaries.
They said they opted for those jobs for better payments despite security concerns.
A female medical officer told Dawn on condition of anonymity that it was very difficult for women to work in tribal districts but she and other female medics had to do so to earn for their families.
“We demand the immediate release of salaries and regularisation of our services,” she said.
The woman doctor said she and her colleagues were appointed to those posts in a transparent process, so the government should regularise their services to ensure regular payments to them like other government employees, who received salary at the start of every month.
She warned that any further delay in salary payment to doctors would hamper healthcare in tribal districts.
An unpaid EMO told Dawn that under the contract, he was appointed for a fixed amount of money and had to serve in the place of appointment, so the transfer wasn’t possible.
He said the government could terminate the services of the AIP doctors anytime without assigning any reason.

6,PHC seeks govt response in promotion quota case,Petition challenges allocation of PMS posts for members of ministerial staff,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has directed the provincial chief secretary and advocate general to respond to a petition challenging the allocation of three per cent quota for the ministerial staff of the commissioner and deputy commissioner’s offices in the provincial management service (PMS) instead of the secretariat’s employees.
Notices were issued by a bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal for the response after a preliminary hearing into a petition jointly filed by office-bearers of three associations of the secretariat’s ministerial staff against the Oct 10, 2022, notification issued by the chief secretary for changes to the Provincial Management Services Rules, 2007.
The petitioners include Civil Secretariat Superintendents, Assistants and Clerks Association president Zafar Khan, Information Technology Staff Association president Qaiser Khan and PS and PA Stenographer Association senior vice-president Tasawar Iqbal.
They said the notification changed the PMS Rules reducing 20 per cent share of tehsildars in PMS posts to be filled through promotion and assigning three per cent of it to the ministerial staff of the commissioner and deputy commissioner’s offices instead of allocating the same for the secretariat staff.
The bench observed that as the petitioners had challenged amendments to the rules, it would be appropriate to issue a notice to the advocate general for response.

Petition challenges allocation of PMS posts for members of ministerial staff

Lawyer Mohammad Farooq Afridi appeared for the petitioners and said the PMS Rules, 2007, were amended in an illegal manner as the mandatory cabinet approval wasn’t there.
He requested the court to declare that notification illegal.
The lawyer also sought orders for respondents, including the chief secretary, to allot proportional promotion quota on “strength-based rationalisation” in the PMS to the petitioners and other members of the Civil Secretariat’s ministerial staff.
Mr Afridi said before the creation of the PMS, the province had two provincial civil service groups, including Provincial Civil Service Executive Group and Secretariat Group, which were governed by their respective rules.
He added that the government introduced the PMS in 2007 and formulated rules for its functioning.
The counsel said for filling the BPS-17 PMS posts, the government had allotted 50 per cent quota by initial recruitment through Public Service Commission and 50 per cent quota by promotion.
He said out of the 50 per cent promotion quota, 20 per cent was allotted to secretariat group comprising superintendents and private secretaries, 20 per cent to tehsildars and 10 per cent quota through in-service exam to the superintendents, private secretaries, personal assistants, assistants, senior scale stenographers, data entry operators and senior and junior clerks.
Mr Afridi said the Board of Revenue, the parent department of tehsildars, had sent a letter to the establishment department on Jan 10, 2019, suggesting reduction of the 20 per cent quota of tehsildars for being over and above the sanctioned strength of tehsildars.
He added that the quota was irrational, so half of it should be specified for members of his clients’ organisations.
The lawyer complained that the respondents notified reduction of the tehsildar quota by three per cent and awarded it to private secretaries and superintendents of the commissioner and deputy commissioner offices to “accommodate three favourites of the government.” He added that the establishment department formally asked those men afterwards to attend a mandatory training course for promotion.

7,Need for modern industrial zones for Peshawar stressed,Study launched on barriers to growth of businesses,"PESHAWAR: Infrastructure bottlenecks, slow digitisation, lack of cheap credit availability and poor entrepreneurial skills are hampering the growth of businesses in the provincial capital, says a study.
It advocated modern industrial zones around Peshawar to meet the growing demand for industrial plots.
The study, whose findings were released in an event here on Thursday, was jointly conducted by the public sector Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (Smeda) and NGO Centre for Governance and Public Accountability (CGPA).
The study titled ‘Barrier to Start, Formalise and Grow a Business in Peshawar and Measures to Remove Barriers’ revealed that the micro-, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) provided around 50 per cent employment worldwide and their role in Pakistan’s economy in terms of GDP contribution, employment generation and overall business growth couldn’t overlooked.
It recommended that the MSME’s revitalisation in KP was imperative for income generation.
The study said during the last two decades, Peshawar’s economy was devastated by terrorist attacks in terms of financial and human capital.

Study launched on barriers to growth of businesses

According to it, the overall precarious law and order situation has impeded business activities in the city.
The study said a lack of collaboration among industry, academia, research institutions and government departments was hindering development of entrepreneurship in the province, so there should be a joint platform for government institutions to combine their synergies to boost business innovations, discuss their problems, and come up with financially viable projects.
It added that boot camps for new entrepreneurs should be arranged by the relevant government departments and they should be linked with investors for seed funding.
The study called for internship schemes in industries and business to provide youth with entrepreneurial experience and equip them with regulatory, evaluation skills and technical knowledge.
It said entrepreneurs struggled to acquire industrial plots for new businesses due to the unavailability of land in the provincial capital’s industrial zones, so they operated from housing colonies to create problems for residents. The model is also not commercially viable for entrepreneurs due to lack of business amenities, it said.
The study said keeping the local and export potential in view, dedicated zones should be set up for marble and granite, furniture, leather and footwear, honey processing and packing, carpet weaving, and gems units with training facilities and modern machinery.
The study pointed out a lack of awareness of laws, rules and incentive schemes by the government. It said the SMEs had less access to information and communication channels and they face hurdles in complying with labor, environmental and social laws.
“Government organisations should organise awareness seminars for the business community, MSMEs sector investors for this purpose,” it said.
The study called for simpler laws, marketing and linkages development, capacity building of SMEs, and easy access to finance.
Mohammad Saleem briefed participants about the research methodology and findings.
Spokesman for the government Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, who was also in attendance, said he would take up the issues of business community with authorities for resolution.

The tenders for construction of new blocks for CT scan department and psychiatry ward and repair work at some buildings were issued by the communication and works department in 2017, and the overall project was scheduled to be completed by end of 2021. 
DHQ hospital deputy medical superintendent Dr Sajjad Khan said they had submitted several letters to the relevant department and the deputy commissioner requesting them to expedite the work on the ongoing project, but to no avail. 
He said the government had allocated Rs50 million for construction of two new blocks for CT scan department and psychiatry ward, and reconstruction of the doctors’ hostel, nursing hostel for women, construction of boundary wall, gates, etc, but the contractor failed to complete any of the buildings as yet. 
The hospital DMS said the construction activities inside the hospital had been causing problems for both the staff and visiting patients. He said they wanted the contractor to complete the work as soon as possible so that they could establish the CT scan department and provide accommodation to the staff within the facility. 
When contacted, contractor Shamsur Rehman said the project was delayed due to funds shortage. He said the government should ensure availability of funds to the executing agencies so the schemes could be completed in the scheduled time. 
However, Alpuri tehsil chairman Waqar Ahmad said there was no shortage of funds and the contractor was responsible for delay in the project. 
ACTIVISTS JOIN PTI: Several PML-N workers in Malak Khel Sharona area here have quit their party and joined Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. 
They joined PTI during a public meeting held at Malak Khel Sharona where Alpuri tehsil chairman Waqar Ahmad was the chief guest. 
Mr Ahmad said the new entrants, including village councillors Azeem Khan and Mohammad Iqbal, would be given respect in the party.

11,PHC stays execution of five convicted by military courts,Asks ministry to respond to pleas against sentences.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has issued a stay order against the execution of five terror convicts suspending action on their death sentences awarded by military courts.
Two single-member benches issued notices to the defence ministry seeking its response to the petitions filed by convicts against their respective sentences.
The courts declared that as the matter was related to the division bench, the petitions should be placed before the available division bench after the ongoing winter vacation.
Advocate Shabbir Hussain Gigyani appeared before the courts for the petitioners pro bono and said that they were kept in different detention centres and were not aware about their convictions.
He said that recently they were shifted to the Peshawar Central Prison where they came to know that they had been convicted by the military courts and were sentenced to death.

Asks ministry to respond to pleas against sentences

The petitioners included Mohammad Munir of Kohat district and Sharafat Ali, Anwar Ali, Rehmat Ali and Mohammad Ali, all residents of Swat district.
The counsel insisted that all five petitioners were previously ‘missing persons’ and that they were taken into custody during different periods, while their whereabouts were not known for some years.
A news release issued by the ISPR in Sept 2018 declared one of the petitioners, Mohammad Munir, as part of a proscribed militant organisation.
It added that Munir was involved in an attack on the personnel of law-enforcement agencies, which killed police constables Khursheed Khan, Enayat Khan and Moeen Khan and two other officials, and injured 12.
The news release also revealed that the then chief of army staff had confirmed the sentences of death awarded to 13 terrorists, including Mohammad Munir.
However, the counsel for Munir insisted that his client was taken into custody on May 11, 2017, and kept at an undisclosed detention centre before being shifted to the Kohat Internment Centre.
He said that the records showed the arrest of his client in 2017, while failure of authorities to produce him before the relevant court was an illegal and unconstitutional act.
About the other four petitioners, the counsel said that no information was available on record as to when they all were convicted by the military courts and for what acts of terrorism.
The military courts were established in 2015 through the Constitution (Twenty-First Amendment) Act, 2015, to hear the cases of terrorism for a period of two years, which ended on Jan 6, 2017. The period was later extended until March 30, 2019, through the Constitution (Twenty-Third Amendment) Act, 2017.
Similarly, parliament made amendments to the Pakistan Army Act for the inclusion of several offences in the law.
The amendments empowered military courts to try terrorists. However, they were limited to the trial of only those, who claimed or were known to be part of terrorist groups using the name of religion or religious sects to carry out their activities.

SWAT: Snowfall in hilly areas of Swat, Orakzai district and its adjoining mountains, Abbottabad and Galiyat and rain in some plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday turned the weather severely cold. 
In Swat, the snowfall began early in the morning in Malam Jabba, Gabin Jabba, Mankiyal, Pishmal, Kalam, Utror, Gabral, Matiltan and other high altitude parts of the district and it continued intermittently throughout the day. 
A fresh spell of rain that began in the plains of the district, including Mingora, Khwazakhela, Matta, Kabal and Barikot tehsils, turned the weather severely cold. 
The intense cold caused by the fresh snow made living conditions more challenging for the residents in the snowbound regions. 
Meanwhile, a large number of tourists from Peshawar, Mardan, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and other areas thronged Malam Jabba, Gabin Jabba and Kalam to witness the snowfall. 
“After proper planning in view of the weather forecast we reached Malam Jabba on Wednesday night and woke up the next morning to the snowfall excitement,” said Ibrar Ahmad, a tourist from Islamabad who was enjoying snowfall along with his family. 
The tourists in Malam Jabba said they loved to visit the ski resort during winter because it offered them multiple fun activities, including skiing, tubing, snow sliding and a ride on chairlift. 
In Abbottabad, temperature dropped below freezing point as Galiyat received a heavy snowfall and rain on Thursday. 
The Galiyat Development Authority (GDA) has directed the staff to remain vigilant and remove snow from Abbottabad-Nathiagali road. 
GDA spokesman Ahsan Hameed said the snow removing operation would continue to keep the roads open to traffic and all possible facilities would be provided to the tourists. 
Control rooms are fully functional in Nathiagali and Changla Gali where traffic police and Rescue 1122 officials have been deployed. 
A large number of tourists came to enjoy the snowfall while the traffic police issued an advisory for tourists to exercise extreme caution while driving on the hilly roads. 
Our correspondent reported from Kohat that the whole Orakzai district and its adjoining mountains of Darra Adamkhel, Sher Kot, Dana Khula and Mohammadzai town of Kohat received the first snowfall of the year besides rain in the plains making the weather frosty on Thursday. 
Severe cold conditions already persist in the region forcing the people to remain indoors after rainfall started on Wednesday. 
There was no gas in Orakzai and some areas of Kohat and the people burnt wood collected from jungles and coal to keep their houses and cattle warm, a local resident Khan Zaman told this scribe on phone. 
The upper, lower and central Orakzai, including areas of Kalaya, Mamozai, Dabori, Samana, Tirah, Mishti Mela and Sampog, received heavy snowfall which continued till filing of this report. 
In Swabi, the first rain of winter season broke the prolonged dry spell on Thursday. 
Talking to Dawn, the local farmers said that the rain was timely and it would have positive impact on the wheat crop. 
Jabeen Qamar, an agricultural expert, said the winter rains strengthened wheat crop and this was the proper time for farmers to use fertiliser to get better yield.
