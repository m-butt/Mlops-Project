All institutions have been asked to restart classes on Jan 9. 
“Due to expected severity of weather, we have decided to extend winter holidays for one more week. 
“This shall be applicable to class prep - class 10 for all public and private schools within Islamabad Capital Territory. FDE & PIERA have been instructed to issue notification,” Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain tweeted.
Following his announcement, the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) and Private Educational Institutions and Regulatory Authority (Peira) issued notifications. 
The FDE announced that government schools will reopen on Jan 9, while the regulatory body for private schools announced that winter vacations have been extended until Jan 7.
Islamabad’s weather in the month of January remains cold and the temperature significantly decreases.

“Following directions of the federal minster, both FDE and Peira issued notifications ... it is impossible for school students, particularly for kids to attend the morning sessions of schools, therefore, extension in winter vacations is a good step,” said an officer of the education ministry.
Public and private schools have been urged to follow the directive otherwise strict action would be taken against them.

However, unavailability of natural gas during the rain created more problems for the residents.
The sky was overcast on Thursday morning and the rain started in the afternoon which continued till late in the night with small breaks. Due to the drop in the temperature from 2 degrees Celsius to 1 degree on Thursday, a very low pressure of natural gas was reported in most parts of the twin cities.
On the other hand, the light rain created slushy mess in the low lying areas of the garrison city. The Meteorological Department recorded 1mm rain in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. However, it predicted very cold weather in Islamabad with foggy conditions during the morning hours of Friday.
A spokesman for the department stated that a shallow trough of westerly wave was affecting upper parts of the country. He said that a cold and dry weather was expected in most parts of the country, while partly cloudy in upper parts. However, more rain/snow over the mountains is expected in Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and adjoining areas. Dense foggy conditions are likely to prevail over the plain areas of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and upper Sindh.
He said Malam Jabba received three inch snowfall, Kalam two and Murree one inch. He said that on Thursday the lowest minimum temperature of -11 degrees was recorded in Leh while Skardu recorded -10, Gupis, Astore -09, Hunza -06, Kalam, Gilgit -05, Malamjabba -04 and Parachinar, Dir and Bagrote -03.
The light rain brought relief to allergy patients. With the start of chill in the air, the number of seasonal fever patients increased in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
“During rain, allergy cases usually decrease because rain settled down the dust and clean the atmosphere,” said Dr Mazhar Azeem.
On the other hand, the rain threw normal life out of gear in the city areas. The rainwater accumulated on roads and streets in the city. Though there were slow business activities in all main markets, shops selling fish, French fries, samosas and soup did a thriving business.
Traffic jams were witnessed on main roads due to the faulty traffic signals and water accumulation on the roads. The traffic remained suspended at Asghar Mall Chowk, Chandni Chowk, Fowara Chowk, Kamran Market, The Mall and Tench Bhatta.

2,IHC seeks timeline for Islamabad LG polls,"Upset by delays, ECP proposes amendments to law to ensure timely election for lowest tiers.","ISLAMABAD: While the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday sought a new timeline for the local government (LG) elections in the federal capital from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the latter proposed amendments to the legal framework to ensure timelypollsfor the lowest tiers.
IHC Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir was hearing identical petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the Jamaat-i-Islami against the decision concerning the postponement of the LG elections.
A day earlier, Justice Tahir had issued a notice to the attorney general and questioned why the court shouldn’t ask the federal cabinet to pay the amount incurred on the arrangements of LG elections. The court also warned of setting aside ECP’s decision of postponing the elections as well.
Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf told the court that the ECP was also not ready to conduct the elections on Dec 31. The ECP director general informed the court that due to an increase in the number of union councils from 101 to 125, the election watchdog could not conduct polls on Dec 31. He said the ECP had allocated Rs600 million for these elections.
Justice Tahir remarked that the court would initiate contempt proceedings against the ECP for not honouring its commitment to the court to conduct elections on Dec 31. He asked whether the decision to defer polls violated the assurance ECP had submitted to the court.

Upset by delays, ECP proposes amendments tolaw to ensure timely election for lowest tiers

The counsel representing the ECP informed the court that the election act authorised the federal government to increase the number of union councils in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
The court inquired whether the federal government could increase the number of UCs at any time. The ECP’s counsel replied that there was no bar on the government and added that the area of the UCs could be changed in consultation with ECP.
On the court’s query, the ECP director general replied that the delimitation of newly created UCs will be done in two months. Justice Tahir asked who was responsible for the wastage of Rs600 million released for the LG elections. He further remarked that the court would not burden the taxpayers. The ECP official said the commission would present a detailed report about the expenditure incurred on these elections so far.
He informed the bench that the IHC single-member bench had asked the ECP to hear the government’s stance regarding the increase in UCs and added that the ECP postponed the elections after hearing the government as per the directives of the IHC.
The attorney general questioned the maintainability of the petitions.
The government lawyer said how the delay was affecting the fundamental rights of petitioners and added that even though PTI was ruling Punjab it had not even issued a schedule for the local government polls. He argued that it would create problems in case the IHC set aside the decision of postponing the elections. Justice Tahir asked the attorney general and ECP to submit a written reply on Friday and adjourned the hearing.
The petitioner, PTI’s local leader Ali Nawaz Awan through his counsel Sardar Taimoor Aslam informed the court that On June 2, 2022, the ECP had announced the election schedule for 50 UCs. The government increased the UCs to 101. Thereafter, the ECP announced the election schedule for Dec 31.
However, a summary was sent to the federal cabinet, seeking an increase in the number of UCs from 101 to 125. Based on the summary, the number of UCs was increased to 125 vide a notification dated Dec 19. Eventually, the ECP postponed the polls in light of the government’s move to increase UCs.
ECP proposes amendments
Upset by the practice of federal and provincial governments to drag their feet on the local government elections, the ECP proposed amendments to the legal framework to ensure holding of timely elections for the lowest tier.
According to a draft proposal prepared by the ECP’s law wing, an amendment has been proposed in section 219 of the elections act to bind the respective governments to undertake amendments in the local government laws and administrative units well in time.
“The federal government or as the case may be the provincial government shall make necessary arrangements including amendments in the existing local government laws, rules, change or alteration in administrative limits of districts, tehsils and local areas before the expiry of the term of local government,” the proposed amendment in the section reads.
A proposed proviso says that the federal government or as the case may be, the provincial government shall not alter the administrative limits of districts, tehsil and urban and rural local areas after expiry of term of the local government.
“Provided that, in case the existing Local Government system is required to be replaced completely with the new local government system or substantially alter during its currency by any Government, then such enactment shall be made by an Act of majlis-i-shoora (parliament) or the provincial assembly as the case may be at least one year prior to the expiry of local government in a province, cantonment, Islamabad Capital Territory, Federally Administered Tribal Areas or a part thereof,” another proviso reads.
“The commission may make provisions for the conduct of local government elections if no provision or insufficient provision has been made under this Act or the Rules,” it added.
Giving justification for the proposed changes, the document pointed out that Article 32 of the Constitution provided that the state shall encourage local government institutions composed of elected representatives of the areas concerned and in such institutions special representations will be given to peasants, workers and women.

4,No suspect held in terror case produced in court,Interior minister claimed two days ago that four to five suspects have been held in suicide blast case,"ISLAMABAD: Though the interior minister claimed two days ago that suspects had been arrested in connection with last week’s terror attack in the capital, no one has so far been produced in court.
Despite failure to produce the suspects in the court to make their arrest or detention legal, the capital police also remained silent over the details of the development including identification of the suspects.
On Tuesday, a statement issued by the interior ministry said Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah in an interview to a private news channel stated that four to five suspects including their handler had been arrested in the terror attack case.
Advocate Azhar Shah, retired DSP legal of the police, when contacted, told Dawn that a suspect or accused arrested by police in any case, including terrorism, should be produced in court for remand within 24 hours under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code (when investigation cannot be completed in 24 hours.
CrPC 167 states: “Whenever any person is arrested and detained in custody, and it appears that the investigation cannot be completed within the period of twenty-tour hours fixed by section 61, and there are grounds for believing that the accusation or information is well-founded, the officer in-charge of the police-station or the police-officer making the investigation if he is not below the rank of sub-inspector shall forthwith transmit to the [nearest magistrate] a copy of the entries in the diary hereinafter prescribed relating to the case, and shall at the same time forward the accused to such magistrate.”

Interior minister claimed two days ago that four to five suspects have been held in suicide blast case

Under CrPC 61 (person arrested not be detained more than 24 hours), no police officer shall detain in custody a person arrested without warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable, and such period shall not, in the absence of a special order of a magistrate under section 167 exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the magistrate’s court.
Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the Counter-Terrorism Department had seven suspects in custody in connection with the terrorism, and investigation was in progress to establish their involvement in the case. The suspects are under investigation and are yet to be produced in the court as nothing concrete has so far been found against them, they added.
However, they should be produced in the court of law for obtaining their physical remand for investigation and interrogation otherwise their detention was a violation of the law, they added.
The terrorism incident created a sense of insecurity among the residents, especially the diplomatic community in the capital and a number of foreign missions issued advisory for their countrymen.
A police officer, who also worked in the police legal branch, said detaining suspects and accused without taking their remand from the court created doubts which benefited the suspects.
Despite repeated attempts, police officers concerned were not available for comments.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, DIG Sohail Zafar Chattha and other senior officers visited Pims to inquire about the health of constable Mohammad Hanif, who was injured in the Friday’s blast. He presented a bouquet and a cheque to the constable.
The minister paid tributes to the constable for his dutiful and professional performance and for trying to capture the terrorist without fearing for his life. The professionalism and presence of mind of the policemen saved the capital from a major incident, he added.

5,Foreigners’ security at development project sites beefed up: RPO,"TAXILA: Foreigners, particularly the Chinese, working on various development projects should be provided fool proof...","TAXILA: Foreigners, particularly the Chinese, working on various development projects should be provided fool proof security considering the prevailing security situation in the country.
This was stated by Regional Police officer Nasir Mehmood Satti on Thursday. He visited sites of various development projects where foreigners are working to review security arrangements and chaired district crime control meetings to get information about cases, especially progress on heinous crimes. He checked the preparedness of police in case of any emergency and distributed certificates among officials whose performance was excellent during the year. 
“We would never tolerate any negligence and lapse in the security of foreigners and it must be enhanced immediately,” the RPO said, adding that under the joint security programme, a search and strike operation would be executed regularly. Earlier, he chaired a crime control review meeting at the district police office. 
Police establishment, police performance, development projects and security issues, crime rate and challenges to police in respective areas were discussed in the meeting. 
While chairing a crime control review meeting, Mr Satti said that those who spoil the sanctity of the uniform do not deserve any concession and strict action should be taken for violation of discipline and those responsible should be given strict punishment. 
Mr Satti said that maintenance of law, order, checking sexual violence, child abuse and growing street crime would be our focused areas. He was of the view that to ensure the rule of law and maintain peace are the top priorities of the police.
He said that a coordinated crime prevention strategy should be chalked out and implemented by holding divisional crime meetings, timely challan of cases and merit based investigation. 
He said that the implementation of directions issued by the government is being ensured and in this regard all resources are being utilised. 
“Strict legal action should be taken against drug dealers, property mafia, people involved in smuggling and human trafficking, and efforts should be made to control social evils like celebratory firing too,” the RPO said, adding strict action should be taken on the manufacture, sale and consumption of inflammable substances, alcohol and other drugs. Mr Satti emphasised that a zero tolerance policy should be adopted on the incidents of abuse of children and people involved in such incidents should be given severe punishment.

8,Airlines urged not to serve beverages during flights,"Activists ask social welfare departments, NDMA not to accept donations from beverages industry","ISLAMABAD: A non-government organisation has urged airlines not to serve beverages and suggested to food authorities, social welfare departments and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) not to accept donations from the beverages industry.
The letters have been written by Pakistan National Heart Association (Panah). The association has urged airlines that passengers should not be served sugary drinks to travellers.
It stated that beverages were a threat to public health and economy as non-communicable diseases (NCDs) especially obesity and diabetes were increasing at an alarming rate in Pakistan.
“Pakistan has the third highest burden of diabetes worldwide with 33 million people living with diabetes and the rate at which diabetes is increasing in Pakistan is at the top in developing countries. Airlines often serve sugary drinks to their passengers during flight which pose a health risk to the passengers,” it stated in letters sent to top managements of airlines.

Activists ask social welfare departments, NDMA not to accept donations from beverages industry

They have been suggested to serve water and other healthy foods instead of beverages.
Similarly letters, sent to Director Generals (DGs) of Food Authorities, Social Welfare Departments and NDMA, suggested that they should not accept donations from the beverages industry because companies give donations for the marketing of their products.
Secretary General Panah Sanaullah Ghumman, while talking to Dawn, said that Pakistan was the third largest country in terms of diabetes prevalence, over 33 million people were diabetic and 400,000 people died every year due to diabetes and other complications of this silent-killer disease.
“Diabetes can cause blindness, amputations of affected parts, kidney failure, heart attack, depression and in some cases suicide,” he said.
While replying to a question, he said that it was unfortunate that the beverages industry use donations for the marketing of its products.
“That is why we have urged government institutions not to accept donations from the industry because such products become reason of diabetes which put a huge burden of treatment on the families and govt,” Mr Ghumman said.
