0,LHC suggests punishment for striking doctors,Justice Shahid Karim expresses concern over state of affairs in health sector.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday took exception to the culture of strike in the medical profession and observed that the doctors involved in strikes should be transferred to far-flung areas as a punishment.
Justice Shahid Karim observed that the medical profession had no room for politics and protests. The judge was hearing a petition against lack of adequate facilities and free medicines in emergency wards of public and private hospitals. A young doctor filed the petition through Advocate Azhar Siddique.
Justice Karim expressed concern over the state of affairs in the health sector and the strike culture among doctors.
The petitioner’s counsel contended that there was a shortage of doctors in hospitals as well besides a lack of other medical facilities for the patients visiting the emergency wards especially. He asked the court to order the provincial government to ensure provision of satisfactory facilities at both public and private hospitals.
The judge adjourned the hearing till Jan 19 and sought a report from the Punjab Healthcare Commission on the matter. He also directed the commission to apprise the court about the prices of medical tests being charged at the hospitals.

2,"Govt unfreezes Dar’s accounts, assets after changes to NAB law","On SC orders in Panama Papers case, NAB had acted against Dar for ""amassing wealth beyond known sources of income"".","LAHORE: The Lahore city district administration has withdrawn the orders related to the attachment of the Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s bank accounts and properties by writing to the authorities concerned in this regard.  
With withdrawal of the attachment orders that were earlier issued in 2018 following orders of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the entire accounts/properties owned by Mr Dar have now come out of the frozen assets category. 
According to a letter issued by the office of Lahore deputy commissioner, the administration has sought unfreezing of the attached accounts/assets owned by Mr Dar.  
“Please find enclosed herewith a copy of letter (reference: 1 (61) HQ/910/CIT/NAB-L of Dec 1, 2022 and Dec 5, 2022 received from the additional director (staff), NAB, Lahore along with the order of learned accountability court No-1, Islamabad,” reads the letter written to the chief executive officers/presidents of the Allied Bank Limited, Bank Al-Falah Limited, Bank Al-Barka Limited and Habib Bank Limited. 
The DC office through the letter titled “Withdrawal of attachment order- investigation against Muhammad Ishaq Dar, senator & federal minister, for accumulation of assets beyond known sources of income and others (reference No. 21/2017)”, requested the banks’ authorities to ensure compliance with the orders of November 22 passed by the accountability court No.1, Islamabad communicated vide letter No 1 (61) HQ/910/CIT/NAB-L of Dec 1, 2022 issued by NAB and subsequent verification made by the NAB through a letter under same reference on Dec 5.  

On SC orders in Panama Papers case, NAB had acted against him for ‘amassing wealth beyond known sources of income’

“The compliance report must be shared with the quarters concerned under intimation to this office,” the letter concludes. 
Talking to Dawn, an official source in the district admin said the bank authorities have removed embargo imposed earlier on the orders of the NAB court. “Keeping in view the NAB court verdict and orders subsequently issued by the bureau (Lahore chapter), the district admin have withdrawn the attachment orders under which the accounts and assets, including a bunglow in Gulberg (Lahore) of Mr Dar have come out of the frozen category,” the official explained.  
It merits mentioning that the Islamabad accountability court had in October 2018 accepted an application filed by the NAB seeking auction of properties owned by Mr Dar. The court also placed his properties at the disposal of the Punjab government.  
After filing a reference against Mr Dar in the accountability court in September, 2017, NAB had seized all of Mr Dar’s movable and immovable assets, including a house in Gulberg III, Lahore, three plots in Al-Falah Housing Society, Lahore, six acres of land in Islamabad, a two-kanal plot in the Parliamentarians Enclave, Islamabad, a plot in the Senate Cooperative Housing Society, Islamabad, a plot measuring two kanals and another of nine marlas in Islamabad and six vehicles. The bureau had alleged that Mr Dar acquired in his name and/or in his dependants’ names assets worth Rs831.7 million which were disproportionate to his known sources of income.  
For his absconding in a corruption reference, NAB seized Mr Dar’s all movable and immovable assets. 
In July 2019, the Lahore admin in a major operation following orders of the then Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government took possession of about five-kanal house (7-H Hajvery House, Gulberg III). Later the admin also converted the house into a shelter home. 
However, in November 2022, the Islamabad accountability court sent a reference against Mr Dar and others in an assets beyond means case back to the NAB saying it did not have the jurisdiction to act under the new NAB laws.  
The reference had been filed by the anti-corruption watchdog in September 2017 on the recommendations of the Supreme Court in its Panama Papers case verdict. 
“Following the NAB’s letters, we have given possession of Mr Dar’s Gulberg House to the owner’s representative,” Lahore Model Town Assistant Commissioner Arbab Ibrahim confirmed while talking to Dawn on Thursday.

3,Defamation suit: Apex court dismisses Imran’s petition,LAHORE: A Supreme Court three-judge bench with a majority of two to one on Thursday dismissed a petition of former...,"LAHORE: A Supreme Court three-judge bench with a majority of two to one on Thursday dismissed a petition of former prime minister Imran Khan against challenging seizure of his right to file objections to the interrogatories of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a defamation suit against the former.
The bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Ayesha A. Malik heard final arguments of the counsel from both sides before dismissing the petition and upholding the decisions by the Lahore High Court and the trial court.
On behalf of PM Shehbaz, Advocate Mustafa Ramday argued that the trial court held at least 21 hearings from directing the petitioner (Khan) to submit the objections till closing his right to submit the same.
He pointed out that the counsel for Khan sought adjournments on 13 out of 21 hearings before the trial court. He said the petitioner could have filed his objections by simply calling the interrogatories of the respondent (Shehbaz) irrelevant or scandalising.
The bench asked the counsel for Khan as to why he had not submitted the answers simply terming the interrogatories irrelevant or scandalised.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, the counsel for Khan, said the petitioner had told the trial court that the interrogatories were irrelevant to the suit proceedings.
However, the bench observed that the record did not support the version of the petitioner.
The bench dismissed the petition. Justice Malik dissented from the majority decision.PM Shehbaz filed a suit for the recovery of Rs10bn as damages for defamation from Imran Khan in 2017 for accusing the former of offering him Rs10bn through a common friend in exchange for withdrawing the case of Panama Papers pending before the Supreme Court.
Khan filed a contesting statement before the trial court and Shehbaz filed his interrogatories, a copy of which was handed over to the petitioner’s (Khan) counsel for filing answer to the same.  
The petitioner instead of filing answers to the interrogatories, filed objections to the interrogatories. The trial court overruled the objections being filed beyond the stipulated period.
The trial court overruling the objections of Khan directed him to file answers to the interrogatories of the respondent. However, the petitioner did not file the answers. Resultantly, his right of defence was struck by the trial court. The LHC on Dec 7 dismissed a petition of Khan against the decision of the trial court.

5,"CS endorses PPRA decision to scrap waste disposal, medicine contract",Fingers raised at minister’s role who claims he wants to curb corrupt mafia for transparency,"LAHORE: Chief Secretary (CS) Abdullah Sumbal has endorsed the decision of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) to scrap a contract of waste disposal and tender of procurement of medicines worth over Rs8.7 billion after alleged anomalies and violations of the set criteria were found in the bidding process. 
Earlier, the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) had challenged the advice/decision of the PPRA of scrapping the abovementioned tenders.  
Giving his findings on the basis of the legal opinion of Law & Parliamentary Affairs Secretary Akthar Javed, Mr Sumbal declared that the PPRA’s decision/advice could not be challenged under the rules and regulations. 
The secretary law opined that the procuring agency/DGHS had filed a representation against the PPRA MD’s advice in the matter of procurement, namely ‘Management & Operation of Hospital Waste Services in Healthcare Facilities for the Financial Year 2022-23’ when no specific provision was available in the PPRA Act 2009 and the rules made thereafter in 2014 for filing of representation before the CS/chairperson PPRA to assail PPRA MD’s advice. 
“Subsequent to the advice tendered by the law & parliamentary affairs department, it is evident that the procuring agencies can’t challenge the advice of the PPRA under the relevant laws/rules,” reads the letter of the CS.  

Fingers raised at minister’s role who claims he wants to curb corrupt mafia for transparency

The copies of the relevant official documents in the matter are available with Dawn. 
An official said several violations were noticed in the tenders/contracts and he alleged that some officials in the Directorate of Health Services wanted to accommodate some particular firm(s) in the case. 
He said the fingers were raised to the ‘role’ of Punjab Health Minister of Primary & Secondary Healthcare Department Dr Akthar Malik when the DG Health Services issued a controversial notification, making many functions conditional to the approval of the health minister. 
The first such notification had empowered the health minister to play a decisive role in distribution of logistic support, equipment/material and other activities which, otherwise, were a domain of the health secretary. 
“The Minister of P&SHD has been pleased to desire that the prior approval may be sought from the Health Minister office before scheduling any of the subject cited activity,” reads the notification issued by the DG Health office. 
Another interesting aspect of the development was that three MDs of the Project Management Unit (PMU) of the P&SHD have been transferred so far in the wake of the abovementioned tender process. 
On finding that the procuring agency/DGHS changed the criteria to accommodate the particular firm(s), other companies approached the PPRA MD to take notice of the violations to ensure transparency. 
According to the documents, the firms told the PPRA that the procuring agency had invited bids for the ‘management and operations of hospital waste services in healthcare facilities’ for financial year 2022-23. They objected to the amendments made by the procuring agency in evaluation criteria formulated in the bidding documents and apprised the PPRA head that the instant evaluation criteria had been formulated in violation of provisions of PPR-14 and principles of procurement to favour a particular firm. 
“This act of the procuring agency would cause to handle (result in handling of) the project by an incompetent firm which does not have the basic experience for hospital infectious waste management,” read the PPRA findings. 
The PPRA MD said the original evaluation criteria formulated by the procuring agency was amended and the firms involved raised serious reservations. 
Furthermore, only four firms participated in the procurement process and all of them raised grievances (one way or the other) before the PPRA. 
“In the light of the observations, the most plausible and appropriate discourse for the procuring agency may be to cancel/scrap the subject procurement process and to reinitiate the process after reformulating the evaluation criteria as per relevant provisions of the PPR-14 after the fulfillment of all other legal/codal formalities”, the PPRA declared. 
Punjab P&SHD Minister Akhtar Malik said some particular firms were trying to hold a monopoly in the tender process in order to stop the ‘entry’ of new companies. He said that a healthy competition was the only way to ensure transparency and a mafia in the primary & secondary healthcare department and the firms were trying to get favours but he would not allow manipulation of the process. 
“I unearthed massive corruption in the health department and the mafia had been targeting him since then,” he said and added that he was trying to reinitiate the open tender process to give equal opportunities to all the firms. 
To a question about the pre-bidding meeting of the firms he had chaired as health minister which was the domain of the officials of the procuring agency, he said he was attending a meeting when the representatives of the firms suddenly entered. 
“They made a surprise entry in the meeting that was not planned for bidding,” the minister said. 
To another query about the notification of the DG health’s office to empower him to grant approval for the distribution of logistics/equipment, he said he was not aware of the notification in question.

6,No-trust motion again if Parvez evades confidence vote: Kundi,"Says govt trying hard to put economy on the right path, which is a difficult task.","LAHORE: Federal Minister of State on Poverty Alleviation and Social Welfare Faisal Karim Kundi said here on Thursday that the opposition would again move a no-confidence motion in Punjab if Chief Minister Parvez Elahi did not take a vote of confidence as directed by the governor.
Speaking at a press conference at the PPP office, Mr Kundi said that everyone should trust Federal Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, who said that the country would never default on its international financial obligations.
He said that the incumbent federal government was trying hard to put the national economy on the right path which is a difficult task. 
He told a questioner that PTI Chairman Imran Khan was not clear on the date of elections as the former prime minister first said that the polls would be held in the coming March and April and then he said that he did not see any elections in the country in the near future.  
Answering a query, he said that the PPP is not afraid of elections and is ready to contest the electoral exercise whenever it would be held.  
He asked the PTI lawmakers to join their parliamentary duties and bring about reforms in the election and national accountability laws. 
Replying to a question about rumours of a technocratic set-up in the country, he said such a plan existed only in the dreams of Imran Khan otherwise there was no possibility of any such move.
Regarding PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto’s US visit, Mr Kundi said that the PPP chairman’s foreign visits are always fruitful unlike Imran Khan’s.
He said that Imran Khan damaged Pakistan’s relation with China, Saudi Arabia and other friendly countries as well as neighbours. 
The former deputy speaker announced that the government is launching a dynamic survey of Benazir Income Support Programme from Jan 15, 2023. 
He said the government would restore around 0.8 to 0.9 million BISP cards blocked by the PTI during its tenure in power. He said the government has so far distributed more than Rs8.5 billion among the flood victims of Punjab. 
Mr Kundi said that flood victims were waiting for the Rs15 billion financial aid announced by former prime minister Imran Khan. He said 22 districts of Sindh, four of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and three of Punjab were affected by flood. He claimed that the Sindh chief minister worked in the recent floods more than the provincial chief executives of other provinces.

7,SC orders release of pension after 21 years,LAHORE: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Sahiwal food department to complete pension papers of a deceased...,"LAHORE: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Sahiwal food department to complete pension papers of a deceased employee within a week while the accountant general of Punjab was also asked to release and start pension to the legal heir within one week.
A three-judge bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Ayesha A Malik took serious notice of the callous and ugly attitude of the food department for not completing the pension case of its retired employee, food inspector Muhammad Ibrahim, who retired in 2001 but after about 21 years his pension papers were not completed.
Ibrahim filed the petition in 2016 and passed away during the pendency of his case.
He was appointed as food grain supervisor in Sahiwal district and was posted on Aug 15, 1974. During his tenure of service, the petitioner was dismissed from service in 1992 and penalty of recovery of some amount was also imposed on him.The Punjab Service Tribunal reinstated the petitioner, however, upheld the penalty of the recovery. The reinstatement of the petitioner had been upheld by the Supreme Court however, he was not reinstated into service by the department.
The petitioner launched a legal battle for his reinstatement and then for pensionary benefits from pillar to post but could not succeed.
Advocate Hafiz Tariq Nasim, who represented the petitioner as pro bono, contended before the Supreme Court that the service tribunal could not dismiss the petitioner’s appeal in ignorance of rule 1.8 of the Punjab Pension Rules and that too without application of independent judicial mind.
He argued that the food department at maximum could make the recovery of the amount from the gratuity and pensionary benefits of the petitioner but could not deprive him of pension and gratuity.
The bench allowed the petition and directed the department to complete the process to release the pension of the deceased petitioner within one week.

Some locals had reported to police about severe aerial firing during a wedding in Gurala village on Dec 25, however the authorities remained unmoved.  
A video of the aerial firing went viral on social media three days after the incident.

9,‘Reintegration of Returnees’: Training programme turning unskilled labour into skilled workforce,"SAHIWAL: Muhammad Fahad, 22, a resident of Scheme No 3, Sahiwal, moved to Qatar to earn his living after doing...","SAHIWAL: Muhammad Fahad, 22, a resident of Scheme No 3, Sahiwal, moved to Qatar to earn his living after doing Intermediate and started working there as a computer operator. However, soon after his travel abroad, the Covid-19 hit hard the economies of the world as well as the job sector. Many people lost their jobs and Fahad was also among them. He was sent back home and he found himself unemployed with any skill to find a new job.  
Once back, Fahad took admission to a computer programme at the local vocational training. The programme was especially designed by the Pakistan’s technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system for the Pakistani youth like Fahad under the title of ‘Reintegration of Returnees’. Today, Fahad is among 100 candidates who received certificates after successfully completing their seven-month-long training course under the programme designed for such Pakistanis as were sent back home from the UAE and other countries during the coronavirus pandemic.  
The certificate awarding ceremony of a programme was held at a private hotel on Thursday. The programme is running under the umbrella of the Punjab Vocational Training Council (PVTC) through its 146 vocational training institutes across the province. One hundred trainees from two districts–Okara and Sahiwal– received their certificates. They included 60 men and 40 women.  
According to the TVET reform website, “Reintegration of Returnees in Pakistan is an initiative under the TVET Sector Support Programme that offers reintegration assistance to Pakistani returnees and Pakistani nationals, particularly young adults, who return to their home country voluntarily. 
Reintegration of Returnees in Pakistan is an initiative commissioned by German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in partnership with the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC)”. 
Around 50 students were also awarded free ‘tool kits’ related to the courses in refrigeration and air-conditioning and beautician.  
Mr Naveed, the principal of the institute, told Dawn that ‘Reintegration of Returnees’ also inducted the students belonging to the minorities and low-income groups. He said during the Covid-19 outbreak many Pakistanis came back home from foreign countries and they remained unemployed. These workers, he added, were semi-skilled or unskilled but had no certification from any recognised institutions and it was in this background that the PVTC, with the financial assistance of GIZ, started the programme to impart skill training to the unskilled workforce.  
“Tomorrow, they will be inducted on better wages and working conditions whether they stay in Pakistan or return back to the countries they were earlier employed in,” Mr Naveed further said.  
It is important to note that the students inducted in 44 vocational courses at the vocational training institutes across Punjab get free education, monthly stipends/scholarship, training and free toll kits after completion of their courses under the Punjab Vocational Training Council Act 1998. Funds come from the provincial zakat department.  
Many other students like Fahad shared their stories in the certificate awarding ceremony.  
Bushra Naz, the senior manager PVTC, Gulam Ahmed Joyia, the area manager PVTC and Aneesur Rehman, the president of the board of management of the VTIs also addressed the ceremony. Local industrialists and members of the chamber of commerce and industry also participated in the function.

On Dec 23, Yasir Nasir of Chicherwali tehsil in Sialkot’s Pasrur district was having a meal from a hotel at Daska Morr when suddenly a police van arrived and forced him to come with them. On asking the reason, the policemen tortured him publicly, he claimed, and bundled him into their vehicle.  
He further claimed the Pasrur City station house officer (SHO) and other officials brutally tortured him inside the police station, beating him with sticks while hanging him upside down. He said he was being forced to confess to a theft and robbery he hadn’t committed. Police then carried him in their van to his village Chicherwali late at night, searched his house and allegedly harassed and abused his mother and wife.   
Nasir said the Pasrur police then registered a false and baseless first information report (FIR) against him on Dec 24 on charges of making a false call on the 15 helpline. In the same FIR, the name of another man, Muhammad Sohail of Mohalla Sofiabad, Pasrur and who had apparently called on 15, was also mentioned.  
The applicant of the FIR against Nasir, Pasrur Assistant Sub-Inspector Muhammad Tariq, claimed the man was engaged in a transaction involving a motorcycle rickshaw with someone. He wasted police’s time and fuel by making a false call of a theft on the 15 helpline.  
Nasir, meanwhile, said he dealt in motorcycle spare parts, and after obtaining a bail from court, he went to Pasrur City police station to get his medical examination conducted on court order. However, he claimed, the officials there pushed him and him father out of the police station.  
Sialkot district police spokesman Mian Muhammad Razzaq said according to the newly appointed Pasrur SHO, Nasir had reconciled with the police. However, the man claimed he was tortured by police in illegal custody and had not reconciled.  
Nasir demanded justice from Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and the Punjab police chief and strict action against the police officers and employees involved.

At the time of issuance of application forms three months ago, the membership fee was set Rs300,000 but seeing interest, the administration eventually raised the fee to Rs0.4m, 0.5m and then 0.6m. Some 24 hours before the polling day (Dec 28), the fee was raised to Rs0.81m.
