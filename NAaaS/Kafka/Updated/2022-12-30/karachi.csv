0,"Life term of man, three sons commuted",A sessions court had sentenced Ghulam Rind and his sons to life in prison in 2014 for killing a man.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday commuted the life term of a man and his three sons to 20 years in prison in a double murder case. 
It pointed out defects in the investigation of the case and said that the police must take steps on a war footing to improve the capacity of their investigation. 
A sessions court had sentenced Ghulam Rind and his sons, Misri Rind, Mir Mohammad and Mubarak to life in prison in 2014 for killing a man, Jummu, and his son, Nazeer Ahmed, in February 2010 in Thatta. 
However, the convicts had approached the SHC against their conviction and after hearing both sides and examining the record and proceedings, a single-judge bench headed by Justice Omar Sial converted the life imprisonment into 20-year term and ordered the release of appellants since they had already spent over 20 years in prison. 
The bench in its judgement said that the evidence against the appellants was testimonies of three eyewitnesses, the recovery of hatchets, crime weapons, and medical evidence. But, it noted, the evidence of two eyewitnesses was far from being trustworthy or reliable and at the end of the day it was the prosecution’s case which was impacted. 
Similarly, the bench said, another troubling trend was the advice of writer head constable (WHC) to the complainant to produce two eyewitnesses for the investigation of the case. 
“This is a practice that is adversely impacting dispensation of justice. The police must, on a war footing, take steps to improve the capacity of its investigation department in every way,” it added. 
The bench further said that the presence of eyewitnesses at the scene was mired in suspicion, the recovery of the hatchets was also not clear as two witnesses gave different accounts regarding seizure of the crime weapons and one of the witnesses about memo of recovery denying about his presence while the hatchets were not shown as being blood stained in the memo. 
“I am cognizant of the principle that one doubt may be enough to acquit a person yet the potency of that doubt is perhaps an aspect which cannot be ignored as well.

4,"Nigah-i-Aainasaz Mai, a compilation of interviews, launched",KARACHI: “We have learnt everything from our father. Watching him has molded the personalities of me and my...,"


 
KARACHI: “We have learnt everything from our father. Watching him has molded the personalities of me and my siblings. He has taught us to remain well-informed, to work hard, to remain secular in our thinking and to take care of our health and remain fit,” said Dr Naazir Mahmood about his father.
He was speaking at the launch of the book Nigah-i-Aainasaz Mai, based on the interviews conducted by senior scholar Prof Dr Jaffar Ahmed with his nonagenarian father, Rashad Mahmood. The event was organised by the Institute of Historical and Social Research (IHSR) at the Dr Zaki Hasan Auditorium of Sohail University here on Thursday.
“No matter how difficult our financial circumstances, my father always made sure that we had two or three newspapers delivered to our house daily. He wanted us to read the papers and be aware of what was going on around us in the world. He would also make sure that after school, we go to his shop to assist him there. It is from him that we inherited secular views and positive thinking. He showed us that bad people are exceptions and that people generally are all good. He is healthy and fit at age 90 and he has also taught us to not just take care of our minds but also our bodies,” the son added.
Scholar and Director of IHSR Prof Dr Syed Jaffar Ahmed said that he would often notice this elderly gentleman listening intently while seated in the audience during their programmes. “Then we found out that he was Dr Naazir’s father. While indulging in conversation with him, it was obvious how interesting a person he was and how much he had seen in life. It was those experiences, which he went through that had helped him grow as the individual he was, We thought of carrying out interviews with him, which we then transcribed to turn into book form,” said Dr Jaffar.
“Since Rashad Sahab has worked with mirrors and has a mirror shop, we decided to title his book accordingly Nigah-i-Aainasaz Mai, which literally means reflections of a mirror-maker,” he added.
Writer Usman Jami thanked Dr Jaffar for introducing Rashad Mahmood through the book. “He is not a common person, he is a poet, a philosopher, a political worker, a writer and a very hard-working human being. Reading the book helps us connect the dots and find the missing links in our history,” he said.
Writer and intellectual Nadeem Akhter also said that the book has a flow. “The interviews are not disconnected. They have a smooth flow and they also open the mind to make it sharp and observant. The book also gives us the entire history of the Leftist movement and the work of Leftists. Each chapter makes you think objectively while also making you open to all opinions while accepting diversity,” he said.
The author, Rashad Mahmood, himself said that he started working at the age of 10 because his mother was widowed early and he happened to be the eldest of six siblings. “After the passing of my father, my mother started working to earn a living. She worked extremely hard. I learned to work hard from her only,” he said.
“Then as I grew older and entered practical life, I also learned ethics, the meaning of politics. My needs made me aware and made me mature. I realised how people can cheat you, how they can rob you of your rights. When you work hard and you are paid less than what you deserve, you get to learn of society and capitalism. You also learn about trade unionism, communism and Marxism,” he said.
“Today, don’t we often hear and say that we should learn from the Chinese? But there is a misconception about communism here. It is thought that it is a system of government that makes everyone poor. But China is not poor. China has given us CPEC. Today, who is saying that we should not work on the CPEC? They are not the communists who are saying it,” he said.
“Marxism is a view, its a vision, its a way of life. If you are against it, then why do you contradict yourself by saying that you should learn from China or follow China?” He said.
Writer and author Zahida Hina, who was presiding over the event, said that Rashad Sahab is a living example of nine decades of splendid life. “He is a treasure trove of education and practicality. He still has a very sharp mind and loves to recite suitable verses for every occasion where he happens to speak,” she said.
“His healthy outlook on life, his hopefulness, his optimism has given him the strength to face all circumstances,” she concluded.
Asad Butt of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, academic Dr Anis Zaidi and Journalist Nazeer Laghari also spoke.

5,‘Excessive use of plastic among major causes of urban flooding’,HYDERABAD: Speakers at a workshop on youth engagement in environmental sustainability and waste management have said...,"HYDERABAD: Speakers at a workshop on youth engagement in environmental sustainability and waste management have said that excessive use of plastic is among major causes of urban flooding as it is well known that plastic bags choke drains. 
They said at the four-day workshop, which concluded here on Thursday, proposed that landfill sites should be developed and waste to energy interventions be initiated by government and private sectors. It was organised by Sindh Community Foundation (SFC) in collaboration with AstraZeneca under its Step-Up health programme.
They demanded the government develop an effective solid waste management plan for Hyderabad by engaging young people to change the behaviour of people. The citizen’s engagement was needed to address environmental sustainability through waste management, they said. 
They also discussed climate change, environmental management, laws and regulations, waste management situation and practices in Pakistan in general and in Hyderabad in particular and impact of poor environmental and waste management.
SCF’s Javed Soz said that poor waste management had multiplied air pollution and affected human and environmental health in urban centres. Activism led by youth and advocacy were needed to improve environmental health and hence mental health of young people, he said. 
Dr Eshwar Das, a psychiatrist, spoke about the impact of poor waste management practices on mental health and said that a better environment always left a positive impact on mental health and poor waste management and polluted environmental conditions led to mental health issues including irritation, stress, depression and difficulty in breathing.
Dr Safar Korai, environmental expert, said that increase in population and poor waste management practices and lack of collection of solid waste management by municipal services were key factors for the deterioration of the environment.
He said the city generated 2,000 tonnes of solid waste management on a daily basis while only 20pc waste collection was done by municipal services and 80pc waste threatened the environment and biodiversity.
He said that excessive use of plastic was among the major causes of urban flooding as plastic bags choked drainage lines. Landfill sites must be developed and waste to energy interventions needed to be initiated by government and private sectors, he said.
Dr Ismail Kumbhar said that environmental problems posed a threat to development yet they were not given priority. Sheeraz Memon, chairman of Institute of Environmental Enginee-ring of Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, said that climate change was impacting the environment.
He said that waste management issues needed urgent attention and should be brought at par with global standards. Hyderabad city lacked dumping sites, he said. 
The organisers formed six groups from among the participants in the workshop who vowed to take social environmental action, campaign for awareness among citizens and install recycling waste bins at six locations across Hyderabad including Naseem Nagar, Chandio Goth, Marvi Town, Sheedi Goth, Latifabad unit-7 and Phulelli.

6,Protest held against police failure to check kidnappings,"SUKKUR: Activists of political and religious parties, civil society and members of general public gathered outside...","SUKKUR: Activists of political and religious parties, civil society and members of general public gathered outside SSP office in Kandhkot on Thursday and staged a protest against police failure to recover 21 hostages kidnapped from different areas of the district.
They said that police had utterly failed to restore law and order in the district, leaving the citizens at the mercy of outlaws who had challenged the writ of the government as they carried out their criminal activities unabated without a shred of fear.
Talking to media persons, Ghulam Mustafa and others of Sindh Mallah Forum, which had organised the protest, Jamaat-i-Islami provincial leader Hafiz Nasarullah Channa, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s Molvi Mohammad Ibrahim Khaki, Sindh United Party leader Zareef Sagar Bijarani, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Abdul Azziz Soomro, Mir Faiq Ali Jakhrani of Majlis-i-Wahdatul Muslimeen, and Maulana Jaffar of Shia Ulema Council demanded immediate recovery of all the kidnapped persons.
They demanded immediate recovery of Ghulam Rasool Meerani, who was kidnapped in the jurisdiction of Bakhshapur police station 45 days ago, and other missing persons including Singhar Malik abducted from Kandhkot-Kashmore.
They urged the government to restore rule of law in the district and take stringent measures against criminals and dacoits who robbed people of their valuables and kidnapped them at gunpoint without any fear.
They said that police had utterly failed to restore law and order in the district and left the citizens at the mercy of outlaws, who had challenged the writ of the government.
The hostages’ relatives said that police did nothing to search for their loved ones but just kept fooling them by raising their hopes. They said that police were deliberately not taking action against the outlaws because abduction for ransom was a lucrative business. They demanded the government take notice of 21 kidnapped persons, including Ghulam Rasool and Singhar Malik. Later, DSP Syed Asghar Ali Shah negotiated with the protesters and persuaded them to end the protest on the promise that police would release all the hostages from the clutches of kidnappers.

9,Federal govt’s energy conservation plan may be put on hold,"Owners of wedding halls, eateries propose operation till midnight, round-the-clock food delivery also urged.","KARACHI: City’s private stakeholders have expressed their strong reservations over curtailment of business timings as proposed by the federal government under its ‘National Energy Conservation Plan’.
A team of provincial government led by Minister for Labour and Human Resources Saeed Ghani with Excise & Taxation Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla and Minister for Industries Jam Ikaramullah Dharjeo being the other members held a consultative session with representatives of major markets, marriage halls and restaurants to convince them to observe the proposed timings but the other side demanded some relief with a view to save their businesses from collapse.
The ministers’ team was assisted by Karachi Administrator Syed Saif-ur-Rehman, city’s Commissioner Iqbal Memon and senior police officials. Over a dozen organisations representing major markets, marriage halls and restaurant owners attended the meeting.

Owners of wedding halls, eateries propose operation till midnight, round-the-clock food delivery also urged

Matter to go back to Centre
The outcome of the crucial session is likely to cause some delay in implementing the federal plan as the provincial government has held out the assurance that contentions of businessmen, traders and owners of wedding halls and restaurants would be discussed with the relevant federal authorities. 
The Sindh government told the other side that it would “try its best” to find ways so that their commercial interests were not undermined.
The session was called by the provincial government to take the business and trade community on board before taking a decision on the energy conservation plan. It lasted more than three hours during which representatives of the community shared their serious concerns over the proposed closure timings.
Relief in closure timings sought
Saeed Ghani said: “It’s the federal government that has proposed certain stringent measures, including curtailing business hours, due to the country’s unsatisfactory economic situation.” In his conclusive remarks at the session, he said: “The federal government has suggested closure of all markets by 8pm daily and restaurants and wedding halls by 10pm. However, we will try our best to convince the federal authorities to consider concerns of the stakeholders in the city.”
“I hope that the demands put forward by the concerned business owners of the city would be accepted to a great extent,” he said.
The business and trade leaders suggested that shopping centres and retail stores in the city should be allowed to remain open from 11am to 9pm. Some of them demanded that markets should be allowed to remain open till 10pm on Saturdays.
Restaurant owners suggested that eateries in the city should be allowed to operate till 12 midnight and home delivery service should remain functional round-the-clock. 
They suggested that government offices should be closed by 3pm and bank branches should limit their business hours to 4pm daily.
Marriage halls’ owners offered to switch off lights at wedding venues by 11pm and completely close them by 12 midnight after conclusion of ceremonies.
Harassment by police
The businessmen and traders unanimously came up with complaint about “inhuman attitude” of the police, recalling their past experiences that they [police] in such a situation always harassed them and in some cases even treated minor violation of rules as an “act of terrorism”. They also suggested switching off the lights of the signboards to conserve electricity.
Energy conservation plan
The federal government last week came out with its National Energy Conservation Plan citing the principle of “Early to bed, Early to rise” urging nation to “save daylight hours and expect billions in savings”.
The plan envisages drastic measures like closure of markets, eateries and wedding halls by 8pm, work-from-home facility for 20 per cent of government employees, introduction of electric motorbikes, use of energy-efficient bulbs and fans, solarisation of government buildings, water conversation, rain harvesting, use of “conical baffle” devices in gas-run geysers, etc.
