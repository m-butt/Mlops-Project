0,"Makers raise steel prices by up to Rs25,000","New rates issued hover between Rs224,500-225,500 per tonne for 10mm-12mm size and Rs222,500-223,500 for 16mm-25mm size.","KARACHI: Despite slowing down demand for steel bars, manufacturers have revised the prices upward citing supply chain disruptions and high production costs.
“Steel bar prices have been raised by Rs10,000-25,000 per tonne in December,” Chief Executive, F.F. Steel, Zarak K. Khattak told Dawn on Thursday.
The new rates issued by many companies hover between Rs224,500-225,500 per tonne for 10mm-12mm size and Rs222,500-223,500 for 16mm-25mm size.
He said the market was also exploiting the shortage of raw materials by manipulating prices. “Dollar shortage has caused a huge drop in the import of ferrous scrap which is a basic raw material of long steel,” he added.
Mr Khattak said the situation has been further aggravated by the State Bank of Pakistan’s instructions to banks to prioritise the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for essential items. 
As a result, commercial banks have informed even large steel makers of their inability to establish raw material LCs. This in turn has shot up input prices of local scrap and billets whereas end-users of steel products are also locking their orders at higher prices.
He said if steel scrap import LCs are not allowed in near future, steel bar prices would shoot up to Rs250,000 per tonne. He urged Finance Minister Ishaq Dar to add steel scrap to the essential items of the import list.
Steel bar prices hit a record peak of Rs235,000 per tonne in June this year due to an increase in the cost of energy and highly volatile rupee-dollar parity.

2,Pakistan to spend $3bn on flood recovery by end-June,Islamabad will seek soft loans at donors’ moot.,"ISLAMABAD: Having spent about $1.5 billion equivalent from its resources so far on flood rehabilitation, Pakistan would be seeking concessional loans from international development partners during the upcoming ‘donor conference’ in Geneva to build a resilient future with over $16bn worth of recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.
Talking to journalists, Secretary Minis­try for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Syed Zafar Ali Shah said that the reconstruction and rehabilitation was an ongoing process and besides the about $1.5bn worth of expenditure so far, the spending on flood-hit areas would increase to $3bn by end of the current fiscal year.
About Rs400bn more will be spent till the end of 2022-23 in flood-hit areas for rehabilitation of infrastructure, agriculture and other sectors, he said.
“By June 30, we are planning to spend $2.5 to $3bn in the flood-hit areas from our resources and repurposing of loans”, he adds. The compensation amount, he said, was also being distributed through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), he said.

Islamabad will seek soft loans at donors’ moot 

Mr Shah said that according to estimates finalised in October through the support of international aid agencies, a total of $ 30.1bn in damages and economic losses had been caused by floods. The estimated needs for rehabilitation and reconstruction in a resilient way were put at least $16.3bn without including much-needed new investments beyond the affected assets to support Pakistan’s adaptation to climate change and overall resilience of the country to future climate shocks.
He said housing, agriculture and livestock and transport & communications sectors suffered the most during floods with their respective losses estimated at $5.6bn, $3.7bn and $3.3bn. 
Sindh is the worst affected province with close to 70pc of total damages and losses, followed by Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
Giving a break-up, he said losses in Sindh stood at $20bn followed by $4bn in Balochistan and $700m each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab and $5bn of inter-provincial infrastructure. 
However, he said the damage assessment in Sindh and Balochistan was still in progress. Responding to a question he said, the utilisation of the Public Sector Development Programme had been very slow at about 14pc by the third week of December against the total allocations despite healthy authorisations. 
He said the Planning Division had authorised Rs257bn so far for PSDP projects but the relevant agencies could utilise only Rs145bn against a PSDP budget of Rs727bn.

5,Export finance markup rates raised to 13pc,Exporters already fear 30pc fall in December figures.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has raised the export refinancing markup rates by 200 basis points, bringing them close to the current policy interest rate of 16 per cent.
In a circular issued on Thursday, the central bank said it had decided to reduce the gap between its policy rate and the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) and Long-Term Fin­ancing Facility (LTFF) rates from the existing 5pc to 3pc.
Accordingly, markup rates for financing under EFS (Part-I and Part-II) and LTFF have been increased from the existing 11pc to 13pc a year each with effect from Dec 30 (today), the bank said.
Now when the SBP changes its policy rate in future, the markup rates for the two facilities “will be revised automatically so that the gap between the policy rate and EFS and LTFF rates is maintained at 3pc”, the bank said.
On May 23, the SBP raised the markup rates for financing under EFS from 5.5pc to 7.5pc and under LTFF from 5pc to 7pc.

Exporters already fear 30pc fall in December figures 

It also announced at the time that the rates of EFS and LTFF would be linked with the SBP policy rate in future through a formula so that any change in the policy rate was automatically reflected in the rates of these refinance schemes.
“While doing so, it will be ensured that rates on these SBP refinance facilities are maintained at such level that they continue to provide sufficient incentive to the export sector of Pakistan,” it said in that circular.
On July 7, the SBP then linked these rates with the policy rates, raising the markup rates for EFS and LTFF to 10pc a year and thus maintaining the gap at 5pc. The policy was hovering at 15pc at the time.
When the policy rate jumped by 100 basis points to 16pc in late November, the markup rates rose in unison to 11pc in view of the 5pc gap. The SBP has now reduced the gap to 3pc.
A dearth of export orders
The export sector is having difficulty getting orders from developed economies due to declining purchasing power in the United States and the European Union. Exporters are highly critical of a high interest rate of 16pc while the incentive of cheaper money has almost been withdrawn.
Exporters said that instead of facilitating the sector, the government had been trying to create hurdles with higher interest rates.
“I fear a 30pc to 32pc decline in exports in December. It reflects the market conditions and our policy regarding the exports,” said Jawed Bilwani, a manufacturer and exporter of textile products.
He feared that the interest rate might reach close to the current inflation rate of 25 per cent.
“We have no export orders. The warehouses in the United States and Europe are full of products. There is no chance of orders until the end of January,” he said, adding that February could offer some respite.
However, he insisted that the higher interest rate and the “anti-export policy” would not allow the sector to increase exports.
He said for the last two months, factories had been working at 50pc to 60pc capacity, indicating an economic slowdown.

6,SBP’s forex reserves fall to eight-year low,Experts reluctant to accept Dar’s ‘optimism’.,"KARACHI: With the expected IMF tranche still nowhere to be seen, State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves on Thursday further declined by $294 million to $5.8 billion — their eight years’ low — making it even more difficult for the country to repay its foreign debts. 
The country has been facing a worrisome scenario as the reserves are not enough to service its huge foreign debt.  
Though Finance Minister Ishaq Dar insists Pakistan will not default, the situation on the ground hardly supports his assertions.  

 





 
The central bank’s foreign exchange reserves have been persistently falling since the beginning of FY23. Analysts and experts paint a gloomy picture for the state of economy as they believe that the country is close to default. They are not simply ready to buy the finance minister’s statement on default. 
Since the change of government in Islamabad earlier this year, the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves have been falling and the few inflows over this period have proved to be too little to meet heavy payments. In April, when the Imran-led PTI government was replaced by the Shehbaz-led PDM government, the reserves stood at $10.5bn as compared to $5.8bn on Dec 23. 

Experts reluctant to accept Dar’s ‘optimism’

The fear of default is also evident from the exchange rate instability which has eroded the value of local currency against all the major currencies, particularly the US dollar. A US dollar, which was sold at Rs180 in April, traded at Rs226 in the inter-bank market on Thursday. Yet, the greenback has almost vanished from the open market over the last couple of months. Worse, a grey market has emerged due to the shortage of American dollar which is offering a dollar for Rs260 to Rs270, against the inter-bank rate of Rs226. 
This significant difference in the rates has already started affecting the remittances coming through official banking channels with inflows witnessing a falling trend.  
Approximately, Pakistan is losing about $300m remittance per month. Bankers said the low exchange rate being managed by the State Bank artificially has diverted this $300m to the illegal grey market. Currency experts said if this trend continues then more remittances would go to the grey market and the country would lose about $4bn at the end of the current fiscal FY23. 
The poor economic growth has already slashed the foreign direct investment in the country as it received just $430m during July-Nov FY23, compared to $885m in the same period last year — a decline of 51 per cent. 
All stakeholders, except the foreign minister, were found to be extremely worried about the weakening health of foreign exchange reserves. They said the finance minister must announce that he had arranged payments to be made for the debt servicing. Neither China nor Saudi Arabia has so far announced that they are going to help save Pakistan from default.  
The State Bank reported that the country’s overall reserves were $11.707bn, including $5.88bn of the commercial banks.

7,Talks with friends for fresh loans progressing: Aisha Pasha,State minister says Pakistan will honour its external payment obligations; finance minister to engage IMF in Geneva for bailout.,"ISLAMABAD: Snubbing sovereign default possibility, Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha on Thursday said the discussions with China and Saudi Arabia were continuing for inflows of $3 billion each and the government was also in contact with International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout.
Talking to journalists after a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Dr Pasha said there was no possibility of Pakistan’s default whatsoever. She said the IMF staff was currently on annual holidays but Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has meetings with the fund authorities during the upcoming donor’s conference scheduled to begin on Jan 9 in Geneva. She said Pakistan would honour all its external payment obligations.
Earlier, the minister while responding to difficulties faced by investors on opening letters of credit for imports told the committee that the restrictions had been in place because of economic challenges but were being gradually eased.
The committee meeting presided over by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla discussed in detail the restrictions of LCs causing delay in the development and opening of Five Star Hotel named “Movenpick Hotel, Islamabad”. 
She said that the government had to impose some restrictions due to tremendous economic stress and the import of non-essential and luxury items was restricted in the best interest of the country.

She further added that this was just a temporary restriction and will be relaxed as the economic and currency situation improves. The State Bank of Pakistan’s deputy governor also told the meeting that the central bank and government had prioritised imports of petroleum products and other essential items.
The sponsors of the hotel represented by Yasir Ilyas said the 90pc work imports required for the hotel had been arranged but the project was facing delays for almost a year now because of problems in the opening of LCs for $8-9 million worth of imports. 
The committee advised the SBP and the Ministry of Finance that given 90pc work already completed they should consider the specific import requests and work for the mitigation of the problems faced by the businessmen in this regard.
The meeting took up the demand of the businessmen from former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) for waiver of outstanding dues of the Federal Excise Duty/Sales Tax refunds against the industrial undertakings of erstwhile Fata. Representatives of the Malakand Chamber of Commerce and Industry requested the committee to ask the government to table a bill proposing amendments to the Federal Excise Act 2005 providing a waiver of Federal Excise Duty with retrospective effect to steel and ghee & cooking oil industries located in erstwhile Fata and Pata.
