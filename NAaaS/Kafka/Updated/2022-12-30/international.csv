0,"19 killed, scores injured in hotel-casino fire at Cambodian border",Rescuer says victims hurled themselves from a ledge in a desperate bid to escape the flames.,"POIPET: At least 19 people were killed and many others are feared dead in a fire at a Cambodian casino, officials said, with a rescuer describing how victims hurled themselves from a ledge in a desperate bid to escape the flames.
The blaze at the Grand Diamond City hotel-casino in Poipet in Cambodia’s northwest, within view of the Thai border, broke out late on Wednesday night.
“There are 19 dead so far as we see bodies and bones,” said Sek Sokhom, director of Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey provincial information department. He warned the figure  “could be higher” because rescuers have not yet reached parts of the complex.

 





 
A volunteer with Thai rescue group Ruamkatanyu Foundation, who wished to remain anonymous, said his team arrived at around 2am and saw people jump from the building.
“I witnessed people running out of the building to escape from the smoke,” he said. Others packed onto a rooftop to avoid the flames. “Then we saw some people jumping down,” the volunteer said.
Video showed the building consumed by flames, with firefighters struggling to contain the blaze and rescuers attempting to pluck people from a burning ledge.
In one clip, an unidentified man is seen sitting on a window ledge as smoke billows out from behind him. In another, a group of people huddle on a ledge as flames draw near.
A Thai foreign ministry source said they had been coordinating closely with Cambodian authorities,  “including by sending in fire trucks from the Thai side”.
Thai authorities in neighbouring Sa Kaeo province said more than 50 victims had been hospitalised there. Local public health official Prapas Pookduang said 13 of them were  “on life support”. Sa Kaeo Governor Parinya Phothisat said roughly another 60 people caught up in the fire had already been checked and cleared by Thai hospitals.
He said Thai hospitals had treated 79 Thai nationals, 30 Cambodians and eight Indonesians.
The Ruamkatanyu Foundation volunteer said the blaze started on the first floor but spread quickly along carpets, leaping up through the multi-storey building.

1,EU agency calls China traveller screening unjustified,United States and several other countries have introduced mandatory Covid tests on travellers arriving from China.,"STOCKHOLM: The European Union’s health agency said on Thursday it believed the introduction of mandatory Covid screenings of travellers from China was “unjustified”, despite a surge in cases in China.
The United States and several other countries have introduced mandatory Covid tests on travellers arriving from China. But such measures are not necessary for the EU as a whole, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in a statement.
Hospitals across China have been overwhelmed by an explosion of infections following Beijing’s decision to lift strict rules that had largely kept the virus at bay, but tanked the economy and sparked widespread protests.  China said this week it would end mandatory quarantine on arrival, prompting many Chinese to make plans to travel abroad.
 
 

However, the ECDC said it did not currently believe the surge in cases in China would impact the epidemiological situation in the EU “given higher population immunity, as well as the prior emergence and subsequent replacement of variants currently circulating in China”.
Consequently, the agency considered “screenings and travel measures on travellers from China unjustified”.
Potential imported infections were “rather low” compared to the numbers already circulating on a daily basis, which healthcare systems “are currently able to manage”, the agency added.  The European Commission convened a meeting of the EU’s health security committee on Thursday to discuss possible measures.
“It is crucial that the EU acts united and in coordination regarding any possible public health measures in view of the situation in China,” a commission spokesperson said.
The commission would “continue to facilitate discussions between member states”, the spokesperson added.

2,G7 calls upon Taliban to ‘urgently reverse’ ban on women aid workers,LONDON: G7 foreign ministers on Thursday called on the Taliban to  “urgently reverse” a ban on women working in...,"LONDON: G7 foreign ministers on Thursday called on the Taliban to  “urgently reverse” a ban on women working in Afghanistan’s aid sector.
The ban is the latest blow against women’s rights in Afghanistan since the Taliban reclaimed power last year.
The hardline Islamists also barred women from attending universities earlier this month, prompting global outrage and protests in some Afghan cities.
The G7 ministers along with those of Australia, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands said in a joint statement they were  “gravely concerned that the Taliban’s reckless and dangerous order... puts at risk millions of Afghans who depend on humanitarian assistance for their survival”.
“We call on the Taliban to urgently reverse this decision,” they said in the statement issued by Britain’s foreign ministry. It comes after six aid bodies suspended operations in Afghanistan in response to the ban.
They included Christian Aid, ActionAid, Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE. The International Rescue Com­mittee, which provides emergency response in health, education and other areas and employs 3,000 women across Afghanistan, also said it was suspending services.
“Women are absolutely central to humanitarian and basic needs operations.
Unless they participate in aid delivery in Afghanistan, NGOs will be unable to reach the country’s most vulnerable people to provide food, medicine, winterisation, and other materials and services they need to live,” the G7 statement said.
“The Taliban continue to demonstrate their contempt for the rights, freedoms, and welfare of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls,” it added.
Christian Aid has warned that millions of people in Afghanistan are on the  “verge of starvation”.
“Reports that families are so desperate they have been forced to sell their children to buy food are utterly heartbreaking,” said Christian Aid’s head of global programmes Ray Hasan. A ban on women aid workers would  “only curtail our ability to help the growing number of people in need”, he added.
The Taliban’s ban has come at a time when millions across the country are dependent on humanitarian aid provided by international donors through a vast network of NGOs.
Afghanistan’s economic crisis has only worsened since the Taliban seized power in August last year, which led to Washington freezing billions of dollars of its assets and foreign donors cutting aid.
After the minister of higher education banned women from universities, charging that they too were not properly dressed, protests were forcefully dispersed by the authorities. Since returning to power in August last year, the Taliban had already barred teenage girls from secondary school.
Women have also been pushed out of many government jobs, prevented from travelling without a male relative and ordered to cover up outside of the home, ideally with a burqa.

4,Chinese jet came within ‘20 feet of US aircraft’,US military says incident took place on Dec 21.,"WASHINGTON: A Chinese military plane came within 20 feet (six metres) of the nose of a US air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last week and forced it to take evasive manoeuvres to avoid a collision in international airspace, the US military said on Thursday.
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of “increasingly dangerous behaviour” by Chinese military aircraft.
The incident, which involved a “Chinese Navy J-11 fighter jet” and a US air force RC-135 aircraft, took place on Dec 21, the US military said in a statement.
“We expect all countries in the Indo-Pacific region to use international airspace safely and in accordance with international law,” it added.
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

5,What is the link between winter storms and global warming?,The behavior of winter storms is governed by complex atmospheric dynamics that are more difficult to study.,"WASHINGTON: The world is getting warmer, winters included. The United States, however, has experienced severe winter storms in recent years, and experts are taking a closer look at the link between these extreme cold events and climate change.
While the link between global warming and heat waves is very direct, the behavior of winter storms is governed by complex atmospheric dynamics that are more difficult to study.
Even so,  “there are certain aspects of winter storms (...) where the climate change linkages are fairly strong and robust,” Michael Mann, a climatologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said. For example, the warming of bodies of water — lakes or oceans — influences the amount of snowfall.
In the United States, a mechanism called  “lake-effect snow” occurs around the Great Lakes region on the Canadian border. The city of Buffalo, which sits on the shores of one of the Great Lakes, was hit hard by a lethal snowstorm over Christmas weekend.
The collision between cold air from the north with the warmer water of these lakes causes convection, which leads to snowfall.
“The warmer those lake temperatures, the more moisture (is) in the air, and the greater potential for lake-effect snows,” Michael Mann wrote in a 2018 paper.
“Not surprisingly, we see a long-term increase in lake effect snowfalls as temperatures have warmed during the last century.” 
Polar vortex
There is, however, no consensus on other mechanisms, such as the effect of climate change on the polar vortex and jet stream air currents.
The polar vortex is an air mass above the North Pole, located high in the stratosphere. Humans dwell in the troposphere, and the stratosphere is located just above it.
It is surrounded by a band of rotating air, which acts as a barrier between the cold air in the north, and the warmer air in the south. As the polar vortex weakens, this band of air begins to undulate and take on a more oval shape, bringing more cold air southward.
According to a 2021 study, this type of disturbance is occurring more often, and is reflected in the following two weeks lower in the atmosphere, where the jet stream is located.
This air current, which blows from west to east, again following the border between cold and warm air, then meanders in such a way that it allows cold air from the north to intrude at lower latitudes, particularly over the eastern United States.
“Everybody agrees that when the polar vortex becomes perturbed or disrupted, there is an increase in the probability of severe winter weather,” Judah Cohen, lead author of the study and climatologist for Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER), said. And this  “stretched” polar vortex is exactly what was observed just before the storm that hit the United States this December, he pointed out. The same phenomenon was seen in February 2021, when a bitter cold snap hit Texas, causing massive power outages.
‘Active debate’
But the heart of the debate lies elsewhere: What is causing these increased disturbances in the polar vortex? According to Cohen, they are linked to changes in the Arctic, accelerated by climate change. On the one hand, the rapid melting of sea ice, and on the other, an increase in snow cover in Siberia.

6,Kosovo’s main border crossing with Serbia opens as tensions ease,Barricades dismantled on Serbian side of Merdare border point.,"MITROVICA: Kosovo’s primary border crossing with Serbia was back open on Thursday, dialling down growing tensions that had drawn international calls for de-escalation.
Barricades were dismantled on the Serbian side of the Merdare border point and Kosovo announced the crossing was open a day after Washington and Brussels urged both to ease a simmering crisis.
The latest trouble erupted on Dec 10, when ethnic Serbs put up barricades to protest the arrest of an ex-policeman suspected of being involved in attacks against ethnic Albanian police officers — effectively sealing off traffic on two border crossings.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced removal of the barricades late on Wednesday during his meeting with Kosovo Serb representatives near the border.
Kosovo police on Thursday said in a statement that the  “Merdare border crossing point has been opened for traffic and has returned to full normality”.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, after a bitter war in late 1990s.
But Belgrade still refuses to recognise it and encourages Kosovo’s 120,000 ethnic Serbs to defy Pristina’s authority — especially in the north where they make up the majority.
After the roadblocks were erected, Kosovar police and international peacekeepers were attacked in several shooting incidents, while the Serbian armed forces were put on heightened alert this week.
The European Union and the United States voiced concern over the situation, urged immediate de-escalation and said they are working with both Serbia and Kosovo leaders to seek a political solution to the crisis.
Political analyst Aleksandar Popov said tensions in Kosovo are so high that it would  “only take one stray bullet” to significantly aggravate the situation.

7,UN chief calls for peace in both virtual and real worlds,"In New Year message, Antonio Guterres says ""world needs peace in 2023 more than ever"".","UNITED NATIONS: In his New Year message on Thursday, UN Secretary General António Guterres called for peace in both the real and virtual worlds.
After a year of brutal warfare from Afghanistan to Ukraine, “the world needs peace in 2023 more than ever”, said the UN chief. “We need peace now. Peace with one another, through dialogue to end conflict. Peace with nature and our climate, to build a more sustainable world.” 
In the same message, the secretary general also emphasized the need for peace on the internet. “There also needs to be peace online, so instead of disinformation, and conspiracy theories, all societies can enjoy the Internet free from hate speech and abuse,” he said.  
In 2023, “let’s put peace at the heart of our words and actions”, the UN chief said. “Together, let’s make 2023 a year when peace is restored to our lives, our homes, and our world.”
Peace, he said, was also needed inside families and homes, “so women and girls can live in dignity and safety.” Mr Guterres also stressed the need for peace on streets that too often have seen violent reprisals from security forces in response to peaceful protest.  Demonstrators and whole communities need “the full protection of human rights”, he said, and for those with religious belief, there needs to be peace in places of worship, together with greater tolerance of other faiths.
Meanwhile, a UN report, also released on Thursday, noted that while Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers “face little to no political opposition, they are unable to deal with terrorist groups operating in the country.”
The report points out that while “much of the focus on Afghanistan has centred on the steady erosion of women’s rights, … security has been increasingly challenging under the Taliban.”
The report notes that the Afghan people were rocked by waves of deadly terror attacks, from blasts at schools in April, to the bombing of a mosque in August. The so-called Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for those attacks, also carried out attacks against the Russian and Pakistani embassies, and a hotel hosting many Chinese nationals.
The UN, however, anno­u­nced in December that it is keeping dialogue open with the leaders of the Taliban, despite their differing positions.

Hundreds of thousands of Russians fled to Kazakhstan and other neighbouring states after the war started. Many of them were civilians, crossing legally as they sought to avoid mobilisation.
As an officer of the Federal Protective Service (FSO), which is tasked with protecting the Russian president, Major Mikhail Zhilin, 36, was barred from leaving Russia and he illegally crossed into Kazakhstan in September when it became clear he could be sent to Ukraine.
His wife Yekaterina travelled to Kazakhstan legally with their two children at the same time. Zhilin was detained in Kazakhstan and sentenced to deportation which he tried to preempt by flying to Armenia, only to get detained again before he could board the plane.

9,Brazilian ‘king of football’ Pele dies at 82,"Pele is the only footballer in history to win three World Cups — 1958, 1962 and 1970.","SAO PAULO: Brazilian football icon Pele, widely regarded as the greatest player of all time and a three-time World Cup winner who masterminded the  “beautiful game”, died on Thursday at the age of 82, his family said.
“Everything we are is thanks to you. We love you infinitely. Rest in peace,” daughter Kely Nascimento wrote on Instagram.


Via Kely Nascimento/Instagram.

 
Named athlete of the century by the International Olympic Committee in 1999, Pele is the only footballer in history to win three World Cups — 1958, 1962 and 1970.
Nicknamed  “O Rei” (The King), he scored more than 1,000 goals in one of the most storied careers in sport, before retiring in 1977.
He had been in increasingly fragile health, battling kidney problems and colon cancer -- undergoing surgery for the latter in September 2021, followed by chemotherapy.
Born on October 23, 1940, in Brazil’s south-eastern city of Tres Coracoes, Edson Arantes do Nascimento — Pele’s real name — grew up selling peanuts on the street to help his impoverished family get by.
His parents named him for famed American inventor Thomas Edison.
But he was soon given the nickname Pele, for his mispronunciation of Bile, the name of a goalkeeper at Vasco de Sao Lourenco, where his footballer father once played.
Pele dazzled from the age of 15, when he started playing professionally with Santos. He led the club to a flurry of titles, including back-to-back Interco­ntinental Cups, against Benfica in 1962 and AC Milan in 1963.
Known for his genius with the ball, he epitomised the sublime style of play called  “samba football” in Brazil, where he was declared a  “national treasure”. He scored an all-time record 1,281 goals in 1,363 matches for Santos (1956-74), the Brazilian national team, and the New York Cosmos (1975-77).
But beyond his records, he will be remembered for revolutionising the sport, his ever-present number 10 on his back.
The first global football star, he played a lead role in the game’s transformation into a sporting and commercial powerhouse, tapping his preternatural athleticism despite his relatively small size — 1.70 metres (just under five-foot-seven).
He also played with heart, visible in the iconic black-and-white footage of the 17-year-old phenomenon bursting into tears after helping Brazil to its first World Cup title, in 1958.
Eight years earlier, seeing his father cry when Brazil lost the 1950 World Cup final at home to Uruguay, he had promised to bring the trophy home one day.
Pele reached the pinnacle of his greatness at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, the first broadcast in color, where he starred on what many consider the greatest team of all time, with talents such as Rivellino, Tostao and Jairzinho.
He was often welcomed like royalty when traveling abroad with Santos or the national team. Legend has it in 1969 his arrival in Nigeria was the occasion for a 48-hour truce in the bloody Biafra war.
Pele declined offers to play in Europe, but signed for a brief, lucrative swan song with the Cosmos at the end of his career, bringing his star power to the land of  “soccer.” 
His reign extended beyond the pitch, with gigs as a movie star, singer and later sports minister (1995-1998) — one of the first black cabinet members in Brazil.
But he faced criticism at times in Brazil for remaining quiet on social issues and racism, and for what some saw as his haughty, vain personality.
Unlike Argentine rebel Diego Maradona, his rival for the title of greatest of all time, Pele was seen as close to those in power — including Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime.
Final match 
Pele’s public appearances had grown increasingly rare, and he frequently used a walker or wheelchair.
He was hospitalized several times for urinary infections, then again in 2021 and 2022 for the colon cancer that marked the beginning of the end.
But he met his health problems with trademark humor.
“I will face this match with a smile on my face,” he posted on Instagram in September 2021, after surgery to remove his colon tumor.
He was deeply moved when Maradona, his longtime friend and rival, died of a heart attack in 2020 at age 60.
“The world has lost a legend,” he wrote.
“One day, I hope, we will play soccer together in the sky. “

10,Netanyahu returns to power with extreme-right government,JERUSALEM: Israel’s hawkish veteran Benjamin Netanyahu was sworn in as prime minister on Thursday after a stint in...,"JERUSALEM: Israel’s hawkish veteran Benjamin Netanyahu was sworn in as prime minister on Thursday after a stint in opposition, heading what analysts call the most right-wing government in the country’s history.
Netanyahu, 73, who is fighting corruption charges in court, had already served as premier longer than anyone in Israeli history, leading the country from 1996-1999 and 2009-2021.
“This is the sixth time I’m presenting a government that I’m heading to get parliament’s support, and I’m excited like the first time,” Netanyahu told the Knesset ahead of his swearing-in ceremony.
Parliament voted to approve his government and elected former minister Amir Ohana as the Knesset’s speaker, the first openly gay occupant of the post.
Netanyahu, who casts himself as the guarantor of his country’s security, stressed that his top goal would be  “to thwart Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal” and  “ensure Israel’s military superiority in the region”. 
But he also voiced hopes of  “expanding the circle of peace with Arab countries” following US-brokered normalisation agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.
Former Israeli intelligence minister Eli Cohen, an architect of the normalisation agreements, was named as foreign minister.
Netanyahu was ousted in June 2021 by a motley coalition of leftists, centrists and Arab parties headed by right-winger Naftali Bennett and former TV news anchor Yair Lapid. It didn’t take him long to come back.

“The behaviour of Russian peacekeepers is unacceptable to us. They have become silent bystanders (in Karabakh),” Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said.
Moscow has rebuffed the criticism.
Russia deployed peacekeepers in Karabakh under a ceasefire it brokered in 2020 to end a six-week war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the long-disputed enclave.
Earlier this month Armenia accused Azerbaijan of creating a humanitarian crisis in Karabakh by blocking the sole land link connecting the mountainous enclave to Armenia.
Karabakh’s 120,000 inhabitants are mostly ethnic Armenians and depend on the vital land link, called the Lachin corridor.
