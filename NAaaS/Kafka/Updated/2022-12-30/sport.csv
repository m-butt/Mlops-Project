0,PCB officials drawing huge packages told to decide their future,"“The message has been conveyed to all [officials] that the PCB cannot afford such perks which run into millions,"" says source.","LAHORE: Almost all top-level officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board, particularly those who are drawing hefty salaries, have been conveyed the message by high authorities that the PCB cannot afford huge remunerations, and the Board in this regard has given them time to decide about their future with the organisation.
“The message has been conveyed to all [officials] that the PCB cannot afford such perks which run into millions. Therefore, they have to take a decision on their own,” sources further said.
Some top officials will also be shown the door for their poor performances, as many changes are expected in a few days as a result of the change of guard at the top level in the PCB as Najam Sethi, the head of the interim Manag­ement Committee, replaced Ramiz Raja as chairman.
As a long held tradition, whenever PCB chairman is changed a new-look administration is introduced.
Only previous PCB chief Ramiz, who was nominated for the said post by then prime minister Imran Khan, did not make significant changes in the administration while preferring to mainly continue with the team of his predecessor Ehsan Mani, who was also nominated by Imran.
Ramiz brought in Faisal Hasnain after then-chief executive officer Wasim Khan preferred to resign, soon after he (Ramiz) took charge.
When Mani became PCB chairman, he introduced the formula of paying hefty salaries to top officials — three to six times more than the existing packages.
Meanwhile in the first phase, Human Resource Director Sareena Agha’s resignation was accepted by Sethi. Sareena’s resignation will be effective after two months but she will not come to the office anymore.
Moreover, Director High Performance Centre Nadeem Khan is most likely to leave his position as the PCB has decided to replace him with a foreign coach. Nadeem, after meeting Sethi in a couple of days, may resign, sources told Dawn.
Considering huge salaries, the positions of Faisal Hasnain (CEO) and Sami-ul-Hasan Burni (media director) are also in danger, sources said.
In the first briefing of the PCB Management Committee, sources said, Nadeem failed to give satisfactory replies about his performance as the domestic cricket system remained crippled in the last four years during which even registration and scrutiny of clubs across the country could not be completed. For this reason, no office-bearers from district/zone to provincial level could be elected.
Moreover, after the ongoing home series against New Zealand, PCB’s chief medical officer Dr Najeebullah Soo­m­ro, who is also drawing a hefty package, is most likely to quit.
After the New Zealand series, a new team management will be announced and there is a strong chance that South Africa’s Mickey Arthur, the former head coach of Pakistan, will  lead the management.
Though the PCB had contacted Arthur, his reply was expected to be received in the next four, five days, sources further said.

1,NZ put Pakistan in survival mode after Williamson double ton,KARACHI: Pakistan were pushed into survival mode after Kane Williamson posted his fifth double century to boost New...,"KARACHI: Pakistan were pushed into survival mode after Kane Williamson posted his fifth double century to boost New Zealand on the fourth day of the first Test here at the National Stadium on Thursday.
The hosts lost opener Abdullah Shaf­ique and first drop Shan Masood in the closing minutes of the day and will go into the fifth final day trailing by 97 runs on a pitch that is only deteriorating.
While Abdullah threw his wicket cheaply in a failed attempt to clear mid on off off-spinner Michael Bracewell, Shan was undone when a quicker one by leg-spinner Ish Sodhi trapped him lbw on the backfoot.
Abdullah’s opening partner Imam-ul-Haq, however, was nifty with his feet to counter the rough patches on the pitch. The left-hander consistently played the New Zealand spinners off the bounce, scoring five boundaries to reach 45 not out by the close of the day’s play.
Pakistan would need to bat at least until tea on Friday to avoid their fourth consecutive Test defeat on home soil while New Zealand would look to take quick wickets to go 1-0 up in the two-match series.
New Zealand were able to get themselves into pole position thanks to Williamson, who added 95 to his overnight score to reach 200 not out before the visitors declared at 612-9.
The former New Zealand skipper demonstrated flawless technique and composure to make Pakistan spinners Abrar Ahmed and Nauman Ali look ineffective despite the duo putting up a decent bowling show in terms of discipline.
Abrar bowled nearly 68 overs to register his second five-wicket haul in his third Test outing. Nauman, on the other hand, delivered 63 overs for his three wickets.
Abrar, who made his Test debut against England earlier this month, was full of praise for Williamson.
“I’ve bowled to [Joe] Root as well but I think Williamson was extraordinary,” he said. “Even on good balls, it was easy for him to score runs.”
New Zealand had a two-run lead and four wickets in hand when Willi­amson arrived on the crease with Sodhi at the start of the day’s play.
Had it not been for the tailender’s support, Williamson may not have gone on to reach his double hundred and New Zealand may well have been struggling in the match.
The duo did not score too quickly in the morning session but ensured New Zealand kept wickets in hand and kept finding boundaries whenever the Pakistan bowlers faltered.
Sodhi scored New Zealand’s first boundary of the day when he slapped a wide delivery by Moham­mad Wasim through the covers. The right-arm pacer was reversing the old ball but both Sodhi and Williamson played it late off a slow pitch to stay safe.
Williamson freed his arms with a lofted straight-drive over Abrar’s head an over before getting an lbw decision against him reversed when he missed a sweep shot off Nauman.
Pakistan put pacer Mir Hamza into the attack after they took the new ball and the left-armer was tight with his line and length. He came closest to taking a wicket when he beat Sodhi’s outside edge from around the wicket with the batter at 36.
Television replays later showed the ball had taken a slight edge off the right-hander’s bat, but in that moment no Pakistan player appealed.
Sodhi brought up his 50 with a bou­ndary off Abrar early in the second session. In the next over, Williamson reac­hed 150 runs with a four against Hamza.
From that point on, Williamson took on the attack against Abrar and Nau­man, thanks to some brilliant footwork and sweeping from the 32-year-old.
Sodhi became Pakistan’s first breakthrough of the day when a leading edge forced by Abrar found Pakistan captain Babar Azam on mid-off. The dismissal ended Sodhi’s 180-ball knock off 55 balls and his 154-run partnership with Williamson.
New Zealand tailenders Tim Sou­thee and Neil Wagner were easily dismissed by Nauman and Abrar respectively, before Ajaz Patel hung around to ensure Williamson reached his 200.
“.. It was nice to be out there being a part of number of partnerships that were really valuable for us getting a competitive total,” said Williamson. “It has got us in a reasonably good position but there’s a lot of hard work to do and many things can unfold on the day five of a Test match.
Williamson said the Pakistan batters will have be careful playing on the Karachi surface but believed it was not too difficult to bat on.
“It has definitely deteriorated a bit, there’s a lot more rough,” he said. “There’s a few more things to negotiate as a batter, a little bit of variable bounce, but having said that it’s still a very good surface, lot of hard work and patience going in tomorrow.”

2,Melbourne looks into hosting Test between Pakistan and India,MELBOURNE: The Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) is looking into the possibility of hosting a Test match between India ...,"MELBOURNE: The Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) is looking into the possibility of hosting a Test match between India and Pakistan, who have not played each other in the longest format of the game since 2007 with bilateral cricket between the neighbours suspended.
Since India hosted Pakistan in a bilateral limited overs series in 2013 the pair have only competed against each other at 20- and 50-overs World Cups and the Asia Cup.
The last time they met was at the Twenty20 World Cup in October, where more than 90,000 fans piled into the Melbourne Cricket Ground to watch India win a last-ball thriller.
MCC Chief Executive Stuart Fox said the atmosphere at that match showed there would be no problem filling the venue for a Test series between the two.
“The atmosphere for that game, I’ve never felt anything like it,” Fox told radio station SEN.  “The noise after every ball was phenomenal. Three [Tests] in a row would be lovely at the MCG, you’d fill it every time.
“We’ve taken that up with Cricket Australia. I know the [Victoria] government has as well. It’s enormously complicated from what I can understand, amongst a really busy schedule. So I think that’s probably the greater challenge.”
Fox said he hoped Cricket Australia would keep pushing the proposal with the International Cricket Council, the sport’s global governing body. “When you do see some of the stadiums around the world unoccupied, I think it would be much better to have a full house and that atmosphere and celebrating the game with full houses,” Fox added.
The Australian Asso­ciated Press reported that CA is up for bringing India and Pakistan to Australia for a bilateral series as long as the countries agreed to it.
“It would be up to the two countries to agree, but if there was to be a Test between India and Pakistan on neutral territory, we would of course be interested in the opportunity to host it in Australia,” a CA spokesperson told AAP.
“The supporters of the two teams here for the World Cup were amazing and the vast majority of those fans live in Australia.”
Pakistan are scheduled to play at the MCG in next year’s Boxing Day Test, with Fox saying Australia needed to engage better with multicultural fans.
“I’d love to shoot for 91,000 (spectators next December),” Fox said. “We want them [Pakistan fans] here and it would be fantastic to have a full house day one.”
Ahead of the World Cup match, India legend Ravi Shastri told AAP that 150,000 people would attend a game between the famous rivals if capacity allowed.

3,Afghanistan name Rashid as T20 captain,This will be Rashid’s second stint as captain.,"KABUL: Rashid Khan will captain Afgha­nistan in Twenty20 internationals after being named as the replacement for Mohammad Nabi by the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) on Thursday.
Nabi stepped down as captain in November, after Afghanistan were eliminated from the T20 World Cup without winning a match.
This will be Rashid’s second stint as captain. The spinner resigned immediately after Afghanistan’s squad was announced for the 2021 World Cup last year, saying the selection committee had not obtained his consent for the team. 
“I have the experience of leading my country before, there is a great bunch of guys with whom I have a good understanding and feel pretty comfortable,” Rashid said. 
“We will try to stick together, will work hard to put things on the right track and bring pride and joy to our country and nation.”

4,Djokovic can’t forget being deported but ready to move on in Australia,Djokovic was deported on the eve of the 2022 Australian Open in January for not being vaccinated against Covid-19.,"ADELAIDE: Novak Djokovic will never forget how it felt to be deported from Australia earlier this year but the Serb said his willingness to return for next month’s Grand Slam at Melbourne Park shows the depth of feeling he has for the country.
Djokovic was deported on the eve of the 2022 Australian Open in January for not being vaccinated against Covid-19 and received a three-year travel ban for the country.
However, the former world number one’s visa ban was waived in November, opening up a path for Djokovic to target a 10th Australian Open crown and giving him a chance to tie Rafa Nadal’s mark of 22 Grand Slam titles.
“You can’t forget those events, it’s one of those things that stick with you,” said Djokovic in his first news conference since returning to Australia.
“It stays with you for the rest of your life. It’s something I’ve never experienced before and hopefully never again, but it is a valuable life experience for me.
“But I have to move on and coming back to Australia speaks about how I feel about this country and how I feel about playing here.”
Djokovic will warm up for the Australian Open by playing in the Adelaide International starting on Jan 1 and he is hoping for a warm reception from local fans.
“It’s a great place and the people in Adelaide, and generally in Australia, love tennis, love sports and it’s a sporting nation so hopefully we’re going to have a lot of people watching and we can have a good time,” Djokovic said.
“I’m hoping everything is going to be positive. Obviously, it’s not something that I can predict. I’ll do my best to play some good tennis and bring good emotions and good feelings to the crowd.”
Djokovic said his overall experience in Australia had not been soured by what happened in January.
“What happened 12 months ago was not easy to digest for some time but at the same time I had to move on. Those circumstances will not replace what I have lived in Melbourne and in Australia throughout my entire career,” Djokovic said.
“So I come with positive emotions and I really look forward to playing there. It’s been my favourite Grand Slam, the results prove that.”

5,Australia hammer South Africa in Melbourne to win Test series,"MELBOURNE: South Africa were on the wrong end of a “hammering” against rampant top-ranked Australia on Thursday,...","MELBOURNE: South Africa were on the wrong end of a “hammering” against rampant top-ranked Australia on Thursday, losing the second Test by 182 runs and with it the series.
The loss capped a dismal first two Tests for the visitors who slumped by six wickets in the opener at Brisbane inside two days, with a potential face-saving third match at Sydney still to play. 
“It is not easy at the moment. That was bit of a hammering,” Proteas skipper Dean Elgar said.
Australia declared on Wedne­sday at 575-8 built on the back of man-of-the-match Warner’s 200 and a gutsy 85 from Steve Smith in searing heat, in reply to South Africa’s first innings 189, and then took complete control with the ball.
South Africa resumed day four on 15-1 after Elgar went for a duck before rain halted play early on Wednesday.
But their resistance didn’t last long with three wickets falling before lunch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the rest in the second session as they succumbed for 204.
Temba Bavuma top-scored with 65 while Nathan Lyon took 3-58 in a depleted, injury-hit, attack. 
“The win is right up there. We have had a number of great contests against South Africa over the years. It’s really sweet and something to be proud of,” said Australian skipper Pat Cumm­ins. “I thought how Warner and Smith batted in the heat was pretty gutsy. 
“(Mitchell) Starc and (Came­ron) Green as well, put their injuries behind them and turned up.” 
It leaves South Africa facing a trip to Sydney next week for the final Test with only pride to play for and potentially some changes to a batting line up that has largely failed to fire. 
“We have got to do a lot of reflection going ahead once again. There are a few positives coming out of this Test but not a lot,” Elgar said. “There’s lot to play for (in Sydney), South Africa are a proud cricketing nation and 2-1 sounds a lot better than 3-0,” he added.
Australia will have a new-look team with Green and Starc already ruled out with finger injuries as they race the clock to be ready for a blockbuster series in India in February.
Josh Hazlewood is set to return for Starc after recovering from a side strain, with Green’s replacement to be decided.
The wickets fell despite the hosts’ attack being depleted, with Green, who took 5-27 in their first innings, not bowling due to a fractured finger.
Theunis de Bruyn (28), Sarel Erwee (21) and Khaya Zondo (one) all departed before lunch at the hands of Australia’s high-class pace attack.
Then the spin of Nathan Lyon, and two careless run outs, ended any hope they had in the second session.
Starc was also nursing a bruised and bloodied finger, but he played through the pain and his sheer pace caused plenty of problems.
Erwee, who resumed on seven, hit a superb drive for four off him as his confidence grew, but Starc quickly got his revenge, trapping him lbw with a cracking yorker.
De Bruyn began on six and built up to 28, but he soon followed his team-mate back to the pavilion.
This time Scott Boland did the damage, enticing an edge that was taken by the ever-reliable Smith in the slips for his 150th catch. He is 14th on the all-time list, led by Indian great Rahul Dravid’s 210.
South Africa were under the pump and needed to dig in, but Bavuma inexplicably attempted a single from Cummins and Khaya Zondo was easily run out by a Travis Head underarm throw.
It left them teetering at 65-4 before Bavuma and Kyle Verre­ynne knuckled down.
But Boland struck again soon after lunch with Verreynne, one of their best batsmen this series, out lbw for 33.
Lyon’s spin removed Marco Jansen before another disastrous run out involving Bavuma, with Keshav Maharaj out after a confusing mix-up and Starc made a direct hit.
More weak dismissals by Lyon and a rare wicket for Smith ended the match.

6,Haaland scores twice as City cruise past Leeds,LEEDS: Erling Haaland continued his incredible season in front of goal with a brace to help Manchester City cruise ...,"LEEDS: Erling Haaland continued his incredible season in front of goal with a brace to help Manchester City cruise to a 3-1 victory at Leeds United on Wednesday, ensuring the champions closed the gap to Premier League leaders Arsenal to five points.
The visitors had a hosts of chances in the first half, with Haaland twice denied by fine saves from home goalkeeper Illan Meslier, while England forward Jack Grealish blazed two efforts over from good positions.
It appeared City would go into the interval frustrated, before Spanish midfielder Rodri finally made one count in first half stoppage time, firing home after another Meslier save.
Back in the city of his birth, where his father was a player for Leeds, Norway international Haaland effectively put the game to bed early in the second half with a simple finish, before taking his league tally to 20 for the season in the 64th minute.
Pascal Struijk gave home supporters faint hope of a comeback as he headed home with 17 minutes left, but it was always going to be a consolation against City in this mood.
The victory helped City leapfrog Newcastle into second in the table and move back to within five points of Arsenal at the top of the standings, while Leeds stay 15th, two points clear of the relegation zone.
“I have a (goal) target but I cannot say it,” Haaland told Amazon.  “I just said inside the dressing room that I could have scored five but the most important thing is that we won.
“We have to hunt Arsenal. I could have scored a couple more but that’s life and I have to train more.”
City lost their last league match before the World Cup break to Brentford but dominated from the off in West Yorkshire, with Haaland wasting no time in having a first attempt at goal, seeing his effort to loft the ball into the net well saved after just 36 seconds.
Against the side they conceded 11 goals over two league matches last term, Leeds remained up against it as Haaland was presented with another golden chance to break the deadlock but he again could not beat Meslier.
Kevin De Bruyne opened up the Leeds defence for the opener and when  Riyad Mahrez’s shot was parried by Meslier, Rodri, with City’s 16th shot of the opening period alone, swept the rebound into  the net.
Alfie Haaland took 181 Premier League appearances to score 18 goals in the competition, but his son needed just 14 to overtake him, slotting home Grealish’s pass six minutes into the second half to double City’s lead.
Haaland then smashed the record for number of games needed to reach the 20 mark by converting another Grealish pass to make it three, needing seven fewer matches to reach such a goal tally than the next quickest, Kevin Phillips.
Leeds boss Jesse Marsch felt the timing of the goals his side conceded were their undoing.
“One thing you know about City is that they are able to manipulate the game with possession and unbalance you but they were able to get us on the transition twice and there was a give away from us which gifted them a goal,” Marsch said.
“We contained them well in the first half and we were pretty stable. Then that early goal after the break killed us.”

The defending champion, a 12-time winner of the CNS Open, made the perfect start to his title defence at the Karachi Golf Course on Thursday — only that, there are four others tied with him atop the leaderboard after the first round.
Shabbir was one of five golfers who fired three-under 69 as the tournament teed off on a cloudy morning that gave way to bright sunshine in the afternoon. Alongside him were Hamza Amin, his old rival Moham­mad Munir, Mohammad Naeem and Abdul Zahoor.
“It was a great day for golf,” Munir told Dawn. “The hope is that it continues.”
A shot behind the leaders is Amjad Yousuf and he’s followed by Mohammad Saqib and Mohammad Shahzad, who are tied at 71.
A group of six returned a card of even-par 72 namely Talat Ijaz, Ghazanfar Mehm­ood, Mohammad Sharif, Kha­lid Khan, Mohammad Naqas and Mohammad Sajjad.
Waheed Baloch, the 2013 winner, is in a group of 12 who finished at one-over 73 with Matloob Ahmed, the champion before Shabbir’s victory last year, was among another dozen at 74.
Last year’s runner-up Ahmed Baig finds himself six shots off the lead at 75 after the opening 18 holes and has work to do over the next three rounds.
Nisar Hussain leads the senior professionals after he shot a three-under 69 for a stroke’s lead over Irfan Mehmood.
There’s a more pronounced advantage in the junior professionals’ event with Moha­m­mad Sahil (71) holding a nine-shot lead over Abid Iqbal.
Saad Habib and Saim Sha­zli, the gross winner at last week’s SGA President’s Cup, lead the amateurs’ contest after both finished with 75 in the first round. Salman Jaha­ngir is a shot behind the leading duo.

9,Olympic champion Mayer announces retirement,VIENNA: Three-time Olympic champion Matthias Mayer of Austria announced his retirement from Alpine skiing on...,"VIENNA: Three-time Olympic champion Matthias Mayer of Austria announced his retirement from Alpine skiing on Thursday, saying he had arrived at the decision after days of consideration.
The 32-year-old had a successful outing at this year’s Winter Games in Beijing, taking home gold in the super-G and bronze in the downhill race.
He also claimed super-G gold at the Olympics in Pyeongchang as well as the downhill gold in Sochi. In addition to his Olympic medals, Mayer also racked up 11 World Cup victories.
“There is no main reason, I simply don’t have the bite anymore. I’ve been thinking about it over the last few days and the time has come to stop,” Mayer told reporters in Bormio, Italy.
“Risk has been my passion, but now I have reached the limit.”
Matthias added he will not be competing in the super-G World Cup event in Bormio later on Thursday.

PARIS: Kylian Mbappe scored an injury-time penalty to seal a 2-1 win for Paris St-Germain over Strasbourg in Ligue 1 on Wednesday before admitting he will never get over France’s World Cup final defeat to Argentina.
Mbappe was back in action 10 days after scoring a hat-trick in the final but then seeing the South Americans win in a penalty shootout.
PSG had Neymar sent off for two yellow cards as the Brazilian made an unhappy return to action following his country’s elimination in the World Cup quarter-finals.
PSG’s captain Marquinhos opened the scoring by breaking free from his marker and headed in Neymar’s cross after 14 minutes. The  Brazilian defender, however, deflected Adrien Thomasson’s cross into  his own net in the 51st minute to leave the scores level as some of PSG’s stars appeared to be suffering a post-Qatar hangover.
Neymar picked up a yellow for a petulant flick in the face of a Strasbourg player and then earned another for a blatant dive in the 62nd minute at Parc des Princes for diving in the penalty area.
Mbappe had been a constant menace for PSG but was unable to find the target with two clear-cut chances.
But deep into second-half injury time he was brought down in the penalty area and converted the winner from the spot in the 96th minute.
After the game, Mbappe said of the World Cup defeat:  “I think I’m never going to get over it.
“As I said to my team-mates, there is no reason why the club should pay the price for the failure of the national team, they are two very different situations,” he added.
Argentina superstar Lionel Messi was absent from the PSG lineup after his World Cup-winn­ing exploits.
PSG also announced that their 30-year-old Italian midfielder Marco Verratti has exte­nded his stay at the club until 2026.
In other games, Lille beat 10-man Clermont 2-0 thanks to an Angel Gomes penalty and a late settler from Mohamed Bayo deep in time added on.
Lyon thrashed Brest 4-2 away from home as they push for the European places.
France may have had a glimpse of the future earlier on Wednesday when 17-year-old Monaco forward Eliesse Ben Seghir secured all three points in a 3-2 win over Auxerre on his Ligue 1 debut.
Thierry Henry was two months younger when he scored his first double for Monaco against Lens aged 17 years and 8 months back in 1995, but the brilliance of Ben Seghir’s brace brought back memories of the Arsenal and France star.
Ben Seghir, who does not turn 18 until Febr­uary, came on as a second-half substitute for Wis­s­am Ben Yedder, who had scored from the spot just before half time but was replaced anyway.
The newcomer unleashed his first goal within 12 minutes with an unstoppable shot to put Monaco 2-1 up.
He then delivered a solo effort to savour, delivering a curling winner from outside the box to make it 3-2.
After the final whistle the Monaco players led Ben Seghir to be serenaded by the away fans on a night that will live long in the teenager’s memory.
The win lifts Monaco up to fifth place on 30 points.

13,"Balochistan, SP, KP join CP in Pakistan Cup semi-finals","KARACHI: Balochistan, Southern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa joined Central Punjab to complete the semi-finals...","KARACHI: Balochistan, Southern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa joined Central Punjab to complete the semi-finals line-up of the Pakistan Cup as the tournament’s final round of league matches ended here on Thursday.
Balochistan beat Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa by seven wickets at the NBP Sports Complex and the teams will clash again for the second semi-final on Sunday while Southern Punjab and Central Punjab will vie for a place in Monday’s final on Saturday. 
The defending champions had an easy outing against Khyber Pakht­unkhwa, who were bowled out for just 133 runs with Mohammad Junaid bagging four wickets and Balochistan captain Yasir Shah claiming three victims. Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman was the highest run-scorer the former winners with 32 off 37 balls.
Balochistan chased down the target with 31 overs to spare as opener Imran Butt smashed a 46-ball 63, smashing 10 fours and six. Imran’s opening partner Haseebullah made a quickfire 53, hitting 11 fours in his 32-ball knock. 
The win meant Balochistan finished second in the league round with 12 poi­n­ts. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, despite losing the fixture, ended third with 10 points.
Southern Punjab managed fourth place after a comprehensive eight-wicket win over Northern at the UBL Sports Complex as Mohammad Umair and Sharoon Siraj took four and three wickets respectively to restrict the latter to 120. Mubasir Khan, with 29, and Umar Amin, with 25, were the only notable contributions for Northern.
Mohammad Shehzad then plundered the Northern bowlers for 60 off 50 balls with the help of eight fours and one six to help Southern Punjab chase down the paltry target in less than 16 overs.
Central Punjab, who had already sealed a spot in the semis in the penultimate round of league matches, beat Sindh by 67 runs to finish the side’s Pakistan Cup campaign.
A target of 311 runs was too much for the National T20 Cup champions to chase as they were bowled out for 244 with five overs to spare despite getting decent start of 43 runs by openers Saim Ayub and Sharjeel Khan.
Faraz Ali was the pick of the Sindh batters with 64 while Anwar Ali and Sohail Khan added 30 off 35 and 43 off 29 respectively. The contributions weren’t enough for Sindh as Central Punjab bowler Usama Mir took three wickets.
Earlier, Ahmed Shehzad smashed 67 and Tayyab Tahir hit 59 to boost Central Punjab to a decent total.

Despina Papamichail earlier put Greece 1-0 up with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 win over Isabella Shinikova, and Maria Sakkari can seal the tie with victory over Viktoriya Tomova when Group ‘A’ action resumes on Friday.
The $15 million tournament — which replaces the short-lived ATP Cup men’s team event as the 2023 season opener and concludes with the final in Sydney on Jan 8 — features 18 countries with ties played in Brisbane, Perth and Sydney.
Earlier, Taylor Fritz and Madison Keys began their build-up for next month’s Australian Open with solid displays to give the United States a 2-0 lead over Czech Republic in Sydney.
Fritz began with a 6-3 6-4 win over Jiri Lehecka before Keys downed Marie Bouzkova 6-4 6-3 to put the Ame­ricans in control of the Group ‘C’ tie.
“In a team event, first match of the year, there are always some nerves, so it’s great to come out and get the team ahead,” said Fritz, who saved both break points he faced in the match.
The US can expect a tougher challenge on day two as world number three Jessica Pegula takes on double Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. Frances Tiafoe will then face Tomas Machac.
A mixed doubles match would decide the tie if it was locked at 2-2.
In Brisbane, Italy and Brazil were tied at 1-1 in Group ‘E’ after Lorenzo Musetti downed Felipe Meligeni Alves 6-3, 6-4. Beatriz Haddad Maia earlier put the South Americans ahead with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Martina Trevisan.
Britain made a convincing start as Cameron Norrie eased past Australia’s Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-3, before Katie Swan doubled their advantage with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Zoe Hives.
“It is a tough task to play ‘Demon’ in Australia on this court, him playing at home. He loves playing here,” Norrie said.
France took a 2-0 lead over Argentina after Alize Cornet and Arthur Rinderknech won their matches against Maria Carle and Francisco Cerundolo, while Switzerland have the upper hand in their tie against Kazakhstan thanks to wins by Belinda Bencic and Marc-Andrea Huesler.
