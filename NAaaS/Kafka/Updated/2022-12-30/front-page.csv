0,PTI MNAs finally come face to face with NA speaker,"Ashraf insists on individual meetings, lawmakers adamant their resignations be approved collectively.","• Ashraf insists on individual meetings, lawmakers adamant their resignations be approved collectively
• Party members say they will approach Supreme Court
• Eyebrows raised as Qureshi, Khattak skip meeting
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The issue of resignations of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders from the Nat­ional Assembly remained unsettled on Thursday as a crucial meeting between NA Speaker Pervaiz Ashraf and a PTI delegation failed to break the deadlock.
The PTI delegation was led by former NA speaker Asad Qaiser after senior party leaders Shah Mah­mood Qureshi and Pervez Khattak decided to skip the meeting at the last minute.
Their conspicuous absence from the meeting prompted a summons from PTI Chairman Imran Khan who asked them to visit him in Lahore for an explanation.
“Khan Sahib called both of them in Lahore to attend an important meeting on a possible no-confidence motion against the chief minister,” Fawad Chaudhry said, as he played down the development in a comment to Dawn.
During the meeting which took place in the morning, the PTI did not budge from its demand and asked the speaker to verify the resignations of about 127 MNAs without summoning them in an individual capacity. 
How­ever, Speaker Ashraf said resignations of PTI members could only be accepted under the procedure laid down in the Constitution and the Rules of Business of the National Assembly. Mr Ashraf said resignation letters should be handwritten and each lawmaker needed to appear before the speaker in person to satisfy the custodian of the house regarding their resignation.
The speaker said that some of the PTI members whose resignations were received by the NA Secretariat have applied for leave from the house while some members were attending the proceedings of the house. 
Mr Ashraf urged the lawmakers to come back to parliament and assured that PTI MNAs would be provided with a platform to raise their concerns.
“Doors are never closed in politics and friendly relations among diverse political parties should be maintained. Parliament is the only forum where politicians can sit together and resolve people’s problems,” the NA speaker added.
‘SC to be moved’
Speaking to media persons after the meeting, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said he asked the speaker to forward the resignations of PTI lawmakers to the Election Commission. According to Mr Qaiser, the Supreme Court had already laid down the procedure in the Javed Hashmi case under which collective resignation could be accepted if lawmakers stand up in the house and announce their resignations. 
The PTI leader claimed that none of the PTI MNAs had received their salary and allowances from the NA Secretariat since April this year.
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry regretted the speaker’s decision and said that the party would approach the Supreme Court to ensure that its members’ resignations were accepted. “It is a collective decision of the party and mass resignations should be accepted,” he added.
Mr Chaudhry also took an exception to the government’s decision to release the name of PTI MNAs who had expressed reservations over their resignation letters. The PTI leader said all MNAs Talib Nakai, Ghulam Bibi Bharwana and Ghulam Muhammad Lali had released video messages asking the speaker to accept their resignations.

1,Imran’s party to launch anti-inflation drive today,Fawad says PTI chief will join demos after three weeks,"LAHORE: After a month-long lull, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to launch another protest movement across Pakistan, but this time it would be against “skyrocketing inflation” and the “economic meltdown” in the country.
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry made this announcement while talking to reporters after a meeting of the party’s senior leadership with Chairman Imran Khan at the latter’s Zaman Park residence on Thursday.
Mr Chaudhry said the movement, which will kick off on Friday (today), will continue till the end of the incumbent regime led by the Pakistan Democratic Movement. He added that initially, the PTI MNAs and MPAs would take out rallies in their respective constituencies whereas the next plan of action would be announced by Mr Khan who would join the protest movement after three weeks. 
It may be mentioned that PTI wrapped up its latest ‘Azadi march’ on Nov 27 with an announcement that provincial assemblies of Pun­jab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would be dissolved. The march was supposed to reach Islamabad initially, but it was diverted to Rawal­pindi where PTI chief Imran Khan announced plan for the disbandment of assemblies. 

Fawad says PTI chief will join demos after three weeks

‘Technocrat setup’ 
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry, who had opposed the technocrat government during his media talk on Wednesday, said the matter was discussed during the PTI meeting and the party unanimously rejected this alleged plan. He said the masses would oppose attempts to install a “technocrat government” and added that under the Constitution, only fresh general elections were the way out of this quagmire.  
The former information minister said the PDM government should avoid running away from elections. According to Fawad Chaudhry, former premier Nawaz Sharif was “becoming instrumental in imposition of martial law during the change of guard in the army but Imran Khan’s wisdom helped save the country”. 
“I want to tell the establishment that it should take prudent decisions with respect to the current circumstances, otherwise it will be blamed,” Mr Chaudhry said.
The PTI leader said the PTI and PML-Q would ensure that the Punjab chief minister should take the vote of confidence before Jan 11, when the court would resume hearing on the “unconstitutional order” of the governor removing CM Parvez Elahi and his cabinet.
Mr Chaudhry said that PPP leaders, including Asif Ali Zardari, had reached Punjab with bags full of money to buy Punjab MPAs to defeat the trust vote.  
He added that the politics of turncoats had ended as none of the treasury MPAs would accept “bribes” to skip the trust vote.
The PTI leader urged the Punjab Assembly speaker to share details of the PPP leaders’ activities in Punjab with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). He said the Punjab governor and chief secretary should appear before the Punjab Assembly Privilege Committee and explain notifications pertaining to the removal of the CM and cabinet.
Mr Chaudhry said the PTI senators would also protest in front of a building in Islamabad where Senator Azam Swati was being detained. He said about 45 FIRs had been registered against him — a testament to the violation of human rights in the country.

2,"Three army men martyred, two militants killed in Kurram",PESHAWAR / SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Three Pak­is­tan Army soldiers were mar­tyred in the Arawali area of Khyber...,"PESHAWAR / SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Three Pak­is­tan Army soldiers were mar­tyred in the Arawali area of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa’s Kurram district on Thursday in a gunfight with militants, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
Separately, two people were killed in South Wazir­istan district when security forces opened fire at a car when its driver failed to stop at a checkpoint.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) identified the martyred soldiers as Su­b­edar Shuja Muhammad, 43, who belonged to Khair­pur; Naik Muhammad Ram­zan, 32, who hailed from Khuzdar; and Sepoy Abdul Rehman, 30, a resident of Sukkur.
It said that “an exchange of fire took place between terrorists and security forces in the general area of Arawali, Kurram district. Our troops fought bravely and effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”.
“During an intense exchange of fire, two terrorists were killed. Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the killed terrorists … [who] remained actively involved in terrorist activities against security forces,” it said.
The forces were combing the area for more militants, the ISPR said, adding that the army was determined to “eliminate the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve”.
Two killed in South Waziristan
Two people were killed and another was injured in the South Waziristan district when security forces opened fire at a car with tinted glasses when its driver failed to stop at a checkpoint despite officers signalling it to do so, the police said. 
The incident took place near the Inzar China area of Shakai tehsil, some 30km from Wana, the largest town of South Waziristan.
The two occupants died on the spot and were identified as Ehsanullah and Gulzad, residents of Datta Khel town of North Waziristan tribal district. The injured was identified as Bakhtullah, a resident of South Waziristan, and was shifted to a nearby health facility.
“The case and the connections [of the three occupants with militants] are being investigated since we suspect that one of the two persons killed in the firing incident owned a house in Afghanistan,” SP Investigation Fazal Subhan told Dawn.
According to residents, security forces and the locals at a recent jirga had agreed upon launching a campaign against tinted glasses and voluntarily abandoning their use.
They said banners were also displayed against tinted glasses at different checkpoints. The campaign was launched to stop targeted killings since vehicles with tinted glasses were mostly involved in such incidents.

3,"Govt ‘offered’ technocrat setup, claims Qaiser",PML-N's Khurram Dastgir says there are no serious considerations about a “long-term interim set up to be run by technocrats”.,"ISLAMABAD: Even though the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has been opposing the purported plan to install a technocrat government to take ‘tough’ decisions to save the economy, PTI leader Asad Qaiser formally admitted that such a proposal was “informally” discussed with him by members of the federal government.
Speaking during Geo News’ show Capital Talk on Thursday, Mr Qaiser claimed those who discussed the proposal were members of the incumbent government.
“It was an informal chat in which some people in the government floated the idea of a technocrat government,” he added.
 






He, however, rejected the option of an interim government of technocrats and said “it will be unconstitutional” and his party will never accept it. “We will never accept any such government,” he added.
 
 

However, Energy Minister Khurram Dastagir distanced the government from any plans to bring in an administration of technocrats. He said there were no serious considerations about a “long-term interim set up to be run by technocrats”.
“Such an option might have been discussed in an informal chat but not in a serious discussion,” he said while appearing on the same show.
Former Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman Shabbar Zaidi was the first person who publically mentioned this alleged proposal.
In a TV show, he claimed governments had failed to take extraordinary steps to save the economy. “Due to political expediency, these regimes could not take bold decisions which are unavoidable in the present crisis,” he had added.

4,Over 100 arrested as Gwadar unrest grows,Hundreds still on streets as govt imposes Section 144 banning gatherings of five or more people for a month.,"QUETTA / GWADAR: As the Balochistan government struck with an iron fist at protesters in Gwadar and imposed an emergency law that prohibits the gathering of five or more people, the demonstrators and their leaders continued to pour into the streets — and get arrested — and more joined in from other towns on Thursday.
The police have rounded up some 100 protesters in the last four days after tensions erupted in the district after months of peaceful protests for basic rights. On Thursday, the provincial government imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in Gwadar for one month.
The provincial home minister, Ziaullah Langove, has said that the government would not compromise on the writ of the state and would strictly deal with the elements behind “violent protests” and those “using women as human shields to gain sympathies”.
Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, who is leading the protests, said people were simply asking for their basic rights like water, electricity and jobs, and not a motorway or Orange Line.

Hundreds still on streets as govt imposes Section 144 banning gatherings of five or more people for a month

A statement issued by the Balochistan home department said that under Section 144, “there will be a ban on all kinds of rallies, protests, sit-ins and gatherings of five or more people in the port city of Gwadar”. Displaying arms has also been banned.
However, workers and supporters of the Maulana Rehman-led Haq Do Tehreek (HDT) continued their protest on Thursday in Gwadar, demanding the release of all people and activists of the movement.
All bazaars, banks, shops and business centres remained closed throughout the day amid protest marches on various roads of the port town. Other areas of the coastal district also continued to witness a shutter-down strike for the fourth day.
The protesters and the police clashed in several areas of Gwadar, and people who had been dispersed a day earlier again gathered and blocked the main highway linking the port city with other districts of the Makran division.
The port city remained cut off from Karachi and other areas and all incoming and outgoing traffic was suspended, and so were the internet and other communication services.
Some tourists have been stranded in hotels, as the road leading to the Pearl-Continental hotel was blocked by the protesters.
Reports coming from different sources suggested that people in Pasni, Ormara, Jiwani and Turbat also protested in support of the HDT protesters.
In Turbat, people gathered in front of the Turbat Press Club and tried to take out a rally, but a heavy contingent of police stopped them from coming onto the roads.
Sources said that more people were also arrested in Gwadar and Pasni towns. Over 100 have been arrested during the last four days.
Meanwhile, speaking at a press conference after a high-level meeting on the Gwadar issue on Thursday, Home Minister Langove said the provincial government had decided not to compromise on the writ of the state and security of the Chinese working in Gwadar.
He said the administration would deal with the elements who were continuing their violent protests despite “the government accepting all of their demands” and those “using women as human shields to gain sympathies”. He said people involved in violence during protests and those who attacked government buildings would face legal action.

5,Screening of inbound passengers suggested amid fresh Covid threat,"Sindh govt seeks tests at airports, quarantines; federal health minister says virus situation ‘not worrisome’.","ISLAMABAD / KARACHI: Amid the scare of coronavirus that has once again alerted the country, the government has ordered strict screening at airports along with increased testing across the country to stop the spread of the virus.
The Sindh government has also written to the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) to make testing mandatory for all inbound passengers and quarantine the positive cases
A meeting of the NCOC on Thursday also decided to increase fumigation and use sanitisers at the airports and carry out genome sequencing of positive cases to determine the variants of the virus.
The meeting, held at the National Institute of Health (NIH), was chaired by Federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel.

Sindh govt seeks tests at airports, quarantines; federal health minister says virus situation ‘not worrisome’

Talking to the media after the meeting, Mr Patel assuaged the concerns and said “there was nothing to worry about” as the country’s positivity was only around 0.5pc.
Moreover, he claimed Pakistan was one of few countries where 90 to 95pc of the population has been vaccinated.
According to government data, over 132 million people have been fully vaccinated, while over 139m have received at least one dose.
Eight million children between 5 and 11 years have also been vaccinated, the minister added.
The situation is under control and no death was reported during the last week, he added.
“We are keeping an eye on all borders and random testing has been increased so that the new variants would be detected,” Mr Patel said.
He added the virus was rapidly spreading in some countries and that all possible steps would be taken to stop its spread in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s Border Health Services (BHS) has also directed the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and other stakeholders to conduct rapid testing at the airports and isolate potential cases. 
A letter written by the BHS also advised random sampling of all inbound passengers on international flights.
The CAA, Airport Security Force and all airlines have been asked to facilitate the BHS staff at airports for random sampling.
The decision to increase screenings of inbound travellers was taken after two new variants of Covid-19, Gryphon (Omicron XBB), also termed ‘Nightmare’ variant and BF.7, the sub-lineage of the Omicron variant were reported in China, India, Bangladesh, Japan, the US, Australia and Denmark.
Sindh govt writes to NCOC
In its letter, the Sindh government has also sought mandatory Covid-19 vaccination for international as well as domestic travel.
The letter by Sindh’s health department also suggested isolating passengers showing symptoms similar to Covid-19 and carrying out PCR tests for confirmation.
Those with symptoms but showing negative tests must undergo chest X-rays as a part of pneumonia investigation, the health department requested.
“Mandatory administration of Covid-19 vaccine booster dose with Pfizer Bivalent to citizens who got inoculated six months ago should be ensured, particularly for the elderly people of 65 years age and above,” the letter stated.
The mass gathering may be avoided while mandatory mask-wearing should be ensured in public spaces, it added.
Provincial Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Peechuho said the letter has been written after new variants were discovered in many countries.
She added the variants were yet to arrive in Pakistan, but the authorities must stay vigilant.
Today, the government is “not in a financial position” to spend huge amounts on testing and Covid-related facilities, she said while talking to journalists at an event held at Karachi’s Dow University of Health Sciences on Thursday.

6,Analysis: Are civilian law enforcers ready to deal with militancy 2.0?,"Sporadic instances of ‘extortion calls’, encounters with IS, TTP men indicate their networks still active despite lull in major attacks.","Last week’s suicide bombing in Islamabad came as a wake-up call for the authorities in major urban centres to pull up their socks in the wake of resurgence of terrorism, which has now trickled down from the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces to the federal capital itself.
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack, supposedly as revenge for the killing of their leader Omar Khalid Khorasani, in Afghanistan in August.
But even before the Dec 23 bombing, there were signs militant networks were still present; they may have suffered operationally in the wake of military operations around a decade ago, but their cells were never busted completely.
This is evident from developments like the October encounter with two Islamic State-linked militants, previously affiliated with the TTP, in Karachi, as well as extortion calls in the city over the past few months.

Sporadic instances of ‘extortion calls’, encounters with IS, TTP men indicate their networks still active despite lull in major attacks

Now that the TTP’s ceasefire with the government has formally ended, it is feared that these networks and sleeper cells have been activated, and their main targets appear to be law enforcement agencies. In these circumstances, more than the military, it is civil institutions that must be well-equipped to deal with the menace.
This may prove to be a major challenge, as work on the National Action Plan (NAP) against terrorism appears to have been put on the backburner. The question that arises now is: do civil forces have the capacity and equipment to deal with terrorism?
Senior CTD Karachi official Raja Umer Khattab told Dawn: “I think the TTP can play a role at some level in Karachi, though not at the level they were at in 2014-15.”
This time, he said, the group might change its strategy and facilitate people from outside Karachi to carry out terrorist activities rather than utilising their own resources.
Referring to signs that militants have re-emerged in the city and that they have help, he revealed that last month, some people received extortion calls. However, he said, no one has paid anything so far.
A security official, who wished not to be named, told Dawn that Karachi has been a ‘source of income’ for militant groups through criminal activities like extortion.
Regarding CTD’s ability to counter the TTP challenge, Mr Khattab suggested a revamp of the force.
“CTD personnel need to be trained, equipped with weapons and modern instruments and motivated,” he observed. He regretted that when terrorist attacks reduced, the focus on strengthening the CTD was to some extent eclipsed.
He also suggested monitoring of suspects added to the Fourth Schedule and detection of their possible sources of funding.
Meanwhile, Karachi police chief Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho told Dawn that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had recently approved special packages for strengthening, expanding and revamping the CTD and Special Branch to counter militancy.
He claimed to be cognisant of the threat posed by the TTP in the Sindh capital, but was confident police were well-prepared to neutralise it. He also claimed the TTP’s presence has not been noticed on a ‘big scale’ in Karachi, though there may be sleeper cells that were being monitored.
In Punjab, law enforcers in Rawalpindi and Lahore appear to have finally woken up to the lack of implementation on NAP in the wake of the Islamabad suicide attack. This is evident from the fact that the security alert has been raised from high to “red”, especially in Attock district bordering KP.
Rawalpindi Regional Police Officer Nasir Meh­mood Satti told Dawn he had held a meeting of dis­trict police chiefs of Attock, Jhelum and Cha­kwal and the Rawalpindi city police officer after the Bannu incident to review their preparedness.
The officials acknowledged the need to work on seven points of the NAP, including strengthening security around important installations, churches, educational institutions and police establishments.
Wall-chalking, hate material, use of loudspeakers, temporary residence, and action under the Maintenance of Public Order needed to be implemented strictly.
 
 

He denied the impression that law enforcement agencies had ‘relaxed’ after military operations against terrorists.
“We are well-prepared to combat such activities in light of the recent terrorist attacks in KP. Police have been keeping an eye on suspicious people, but free movement within the country cannot be stopped,” he told Dawn.
But in Lahore, a senior officer on condition of anonymity told Dawn no measures were being taken to implement NAP to counter terrorism owing to political instability in the province.
He said the district police and CTD were not taking any measures against terrorism after a decrease in attacks over the years, and put the onus on the government to address the resurgence of terrorism.
CTD Additional IGP Imran Mehmood also acknowledged that the NAP had lost focus after a considerable decrease in terrorism, but blamed the district police for not paying attention to it. They would have to focus on its implementation, he remarked.
However, he told Dawn, they were all geared up to counter any terrorism incident. No one could prevent terrorism, he maintained, but added major losses could be prevented. He further said counter-terrorism activities were under way and they were unearthing sleeper cells and arresting financiers of militants.
On Thursday, Punjab Inspector General Police (IGP) Amir Zulfiqar Khan visited the CTD headquarters where Mr Mehmood gave a briefing about their operations carried out this year.
He explained 12,429 intelligence-based operations were conducted during the year, 2,251 suspected militants arrested and 64.36kg explosives and a huge cache of arms and ammunition recovered.
The IGP said the fundamental role of CTD was eliminating terrorism, sectarianism and extremism from the province. He directed to accelerate IBOs in view of the rising wave of terrorism.
On the other hand, the CTD has tracked the footprints of TTP and IS in Punjab that emerged after recent arrests of several militants from various districts. The presence of TTP affiliates in the districts bordering Punjab has also raised alarm bells.
Also, 80 people placed on the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 and 270 militants have been found missing from their residences.
Therefore, the authorities have decided to conduct search and sweep operations in various districts of Punjab, especially Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum and Lahore.
Being in close proximity to KP, Attock district could especially be affected by the law and order situation in the province with a spillover effect on Rawalpindi/Islamabad, revealed a report of the Punjab Home Department shared with all divisional police chiefs of the province.
It, therefore, suggested intensifying IBOs in the districts of Punjab located close to KP and Balochistan.
 
 

The report mentioned the Islamabad suicide attack and the assassination attempt on KP Assembly Deputy Speaker Mahmood Jan in Peshawar on the same day as signs terrorism was once again rearing its head after years of calm, and that it was likely to affect Punjab soon.
There are also indications that extremist activities in Attock district and its adjoining areas could fan sectarianism in the area.
The home department report said threats from hostile foreign intelligence agencies, TTP, former Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, IS and Jamaatul Ahrar had already been circulated and needed to be thoroughly analysed for pre-emptive action.
The department also suggested careful deployment of police after thorough consideration keeping in view they were the primary targets, and that measures for their security be beefed up.
