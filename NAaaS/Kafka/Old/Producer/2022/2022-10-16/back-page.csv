0,Turkiye in mourning as mine tragedy claims 41 lives,PM Shehbaz condoles with Turkish people.,"AMASRA: Rescuers on Saturday found the body of the last missing miner at a coal mine in northern Turkiye, bringing the death toll to 41 from a methane blast the previous day.
Shortly after his arrival at the site near the small coal mining town of Amasra on Turkiye’s Black Sea coast on Saturday afternoon, Presid­ent Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the last missing person had been found dead. “Our priority was to find the miners in the gallery. We finally reached the last one. He also died, bringing the number of deaths to 41,” he said, ending rescue operations more than 20 hours after the deadly explosion.
Interior Minister Suley­man Soylu earlier said 58 miners had survived the blast, “either by themselves or thanks to rescuers”. He said 28 people had been inju­red as a result of the blast.

PM Shehbaz condoles with Turkish people

Expressing grief at the tragedy in a post on his Twitter handle, Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif said: “I express our profound sadness at the loss of precious lives in an  explosion at a coal mine in Trkiye’s Bartin province. Our thoughts  & prayers are with the bere­aved families and the Tur­kish people.  May those still trapped are rescued at the earliest.”
 






Turkiye had suffered its deadliest coal mining disaster eight years ago when 301 workers died in a blast in the western town of Soma.
Television images showed anxious crowds — some with tears in their eyes — congregating around a damaged white building near the entrance to the pit in search of news of their friends and loved ones.
Erdogan earlier vowed on Twitter that the incident wo­u­­ld be thoroughly investigated.
Most initial information about those trapped inside was coming from workers who had managed to climb out relatively unharmed though Amasra mayor Recai Cakir said many of those who survived had suffered “serious injuries”.
Mining workers’ union attributed the blast to a build-up of methane gas. However, officials said it was premature to draw definitive conclusions over the cause of the accident.
Rescuers sent in reinforcements from surrounding villages to help in the search and rescue.
Television footage showed paramedics giving oxygen to the miners who had climbed out and then rushing them to the nearest hospitals.
 






The local governor said a team of more than 70 rescuers had managed to reach a point in the pit some 250 metres below.

Scores of jeering and whistling protesters hurled projectiles at security forces near a landmark roundabout in Hamedan city, west of Tehran, in footage verified by AFP.
Despite what online monitor NetBlocks called a  “major disruption to internet traffic”, protesters were also seen pouring onto the streets of the northwestern city of Ardabil, in videos shared on Twitter.
Shopkeepers went on strike in Ami­ni’s hometown Saqez, in Kurdistan province, and Mahabad in West Azerb­aijan, said the 1500tasvir social media channel that monitors protests and police violations.
They were responding to an appeal for a huge turnout for protests on Satu­rday under the catchcry  “The beginning of the end!”  “We have to be present in the squares, because the best VPN these days is the street,” activists declared, referring to virtual private networks used to skirt internet restrictions.
In response to the protests, one of Iran’s main revolutionary bodies, the Islamic Development Coordination Council, has urged people to  “express their revolutionary anger against sedition and rioters” after prayers on Saturday evening.
A call also went out this week for  “retirees” of the Revolutionary Guards to meet on Saturday given  “the current sensitive situation”, according to a journalist at Shargh newspaper.

2,Early hearing of contempt plea against Imran sought,The contempt of court petition was filed against Imran for allegedly flouting the Supreme Court’s May 25 order.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Saturday moved a request before the Supreme Court for early hearing of its contempt of court petition as well as the plea seeking a restraining order for former prime minister Imran Khan against creating a perceived law and order situation through his long march to the capital’s D-Chowk.
Moved through Advocate on Record Anis Muhammad Shahzad on behalf of the Interior Ministry, the application requested the top court to hear the matter preferably from the week commencing Monday.
The contempt of court petition was filed against PTI Chairman Imran Khan for allegedly flouting the Supreme Court’s May 25 order by recalling how the court had ordered the PTI to hold a gathering at the ground located between sectors H-9 and G-9 in view of the categorical assurances on behalf of the party’s top leadership and counsel that their rally would not cause any inconvenience to the public and citizenry or blockage of the Srinagar Highway and that it would be conducted in a peaceful and lawful manner.
Despite these assurances, the PTI’s top leadership, by acting in blatant disregard for the court directions, exhorted its supporters to reach D-Chowk, falsely professing that the court had allowed the march without any conditions.
The contempt petition pleaded for the implementation of the apex court order for the protection of fundamental rights of the public at large, particularly the residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The plea seeking a restraining order claimed the tone and tenor adopted by the PTI chairman in his speeches against the incumbent rulers and state institutions was “highly inflammatory”, aimed at encouraging distrust and contempt and instigating revolt.
