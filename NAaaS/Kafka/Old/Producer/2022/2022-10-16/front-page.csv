• Pakistan conveys demarche to US envoy over president’s ‘misleading’ remarks
• PM says N-assets have best safeguards; Bilawal sees ‘misunderstanding’ behind comments
WASHINGTON / KARACHI: In a stern response, Pakistan has categorically rejected US President Joe Biden’s remarks about the country’s nuclear weapons as “factually incorrect and misleading”, while the American ambassador in Islamabad was summoned to issue an official demarche.
President Biden brought up Pakistan out of the blue at a fundraising event in Cali­fornia on Thursday, while discussing various global threats to US interests.
He said he has spent more time with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping than “any person in — any head of state in America,” he said.
“This is a guy who understands what he wants but has an enormous, enormous array of problems. How do we handle that?” he asked. “How do we handle that relative to what’s going on in Russia?”
And then, totally out of context, he moved on to Pakistan. “What I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan.” And then he explained why he thought Pakistan was dangerous: “Nuclear weapons without any cohesion.”
He mentioned Pakistan while discussing China’s efforts to assert its role as a major world power. “Did anybody think we’d be in a situation where China is trying to figure out its role relative to Russia and relative to India and relative to Pakistan?” Mr. Biden asked.
Mr Biden has hardly mentioned Pakistan since coming to power — except when urging other nations to donate to the flood relief fund — and it was omitted entirely from the new National Security Strategy released this week.
On Friday night, when White House Press Secre­tary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about the president’s comments on Pakis­tan, she said he was saying “nothing new”. “The president views a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests,” she added.
‘Responsible state’
Responding to the development, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday: “Let me reiterate unequivocally: Pakistan is a responsible nuclear state and we are proud that our nuclear assets have the best safeguards as per [Interna­tional Atomic Energy Agency] requirements.”
In a tweet, he added that there should be no doubt that Pakistan took its nuclear safety measures with “utmost seriousness”.
Moreover, in a press statement issued by the PM Office, the premier said Pakistan rejected the US president’s remarks as factually incorrect and misleading, adding it was critically important to make genuine and durable efforts to recognise the real potential of the US-Pakistan relationship while avoiding unnecessary comments.
He stressed that over decades, Pakistan had proven to be a most responsible nuclear state, wherein its nuclear programme was managed through a technically sound and foolproof command and control system. The statement quoted the PM as saying Pakistan had also consistently demonstrated responsible stewardship of its nuclear-weapons capability, marked by a very strong commitment to global standards, including those of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on non-proliferation, safety, and security.
He stated that the real threat to international peace and security was posed by ultra-nationalism, violation of human rights in regions that were struggling against illegal occupation, violation of global norms by some states, repeated nuclear security incidents and arms race among leading nuclear weapon states and introduction of new security constructs that disturb regional balance, a veiled reference to next-door neighbour and long-time rival, India.
“It is our sincere desire to cooperate with the US to promote regional peace and security,” the statement concluded.
Official demarche
Hours before the PM issued a statement, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed surprise at the US president’s remarks, saying the government had decided to summon the American ambassador for an official demarche.
However, in the same breath, he attempted to downplay the situation and expressed his belief that President Biden’s thoughts would not affect the bilateral relations, seeing the comments as “a sort of misunderstanding” that could be removed through frequent engagements and communication.
“As far as President Biden is concerned, I have discussed it with the prime minister and we have decided to summon US Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome for an official demarche,” he replied to a question during a press conference at Bilawal House in Karachi. The foreign minister was confident about the safety of the country’s nuclear assets and wondered about the non-responsive attitude of the international community over recent reports of mishandling of such arms in India.
“We meet each and every international standard in accordance with the IAEA as far as security and safety is concerned,” he asserted. “If there are any questions as to nuclear safety, they should be directed to our neighbour India, who very recently accidentally fired a missile into Pakistani territory. This is not only irresponsible and unsafe but raises genuine and serious concerns about the safety of nuclear-capable countries.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari was confident that President Biden’s thoughts didn’t reflect the official US position on its relations with Pakistan. He called the US president’s remarks a “kind of spontaneous sharing” at a “low-profile function”.
“We are definitely calling the [US] ambassador and issuing a demarche, but I don’t think [the remarks were made at] an official function. It wasn’t an address to parliament or an interview. It was a fundraiser and an informal conversation in which this sentence was used. I think we will look into this statement in this way,” he maintained.
While hoping for flourishing diplomatic ties with the US, the foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s position on Ukraine and explained why the country decided to abstain from voting on a resolution passed in the UN General Assembly earlier this week. He also read out portions of the explanatory note filed by Pakistan.

1,Situationer: Why is US airing N-concerns now?,Everyone looked to have struggled in comprehending Biden’s remarks because they were delivered without explaining the context.,"ISLAMABAD: US President Joe Biden’s surprise comment on Pakistan’s nuclear programme has left the government, which had been determinedly working for fixing the troubled bilateral relationship, gobsmacked.
The reactions from the government and other political leaders seemed to have been formulated on the basis of historical concerns about safety of nuclear arsenal rather than on the actual comments delivered by President Biden. Everyone looked to have struggled in comprehending Biden’s remarks because those had been delivered without explaining the context of the concern.
The assertion that “And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion,” was made while listing the global threats facing the United States in the evolving international environment instead of a standalone threat.
Dean of Faculty of Aerospace and Strategic Studies at Air University  Dr Adil Sultan, who has previously remained a senior official at  Strategic Plans Division, said: “President Biden was most likely  referring to political instability in a country with nuclear weapons. He  did not question nuclear security of Pakistan and this was not the  issue being referred in the transcript available on the White House  website.”
Dr Sultan further said: “The reaction by the media and  almost all the political parties seems to be misdirected. As a result of  this controversy we may have ourselves brought focus on an issue  (threat to nuclear arsenal) that was never under discussion.”
Pakistan had been off Biden’s priorities for a while, therefore, the sudden mention was definitely not without a reason. It could have been a result of some recent briefing that he may have received on situation in Pakistan.
One would be misplaced to think that nuclear security in Pakistan was no more of a concern to US. Ely Ratner, US assistant secretary of defense, had only last month reminded that “US interests associated with defense partnership with Pakistan” were “primarily focused on counterterrorism and nuclear security.”
Washington does not solely see nuclear security from the perspective of the security architecture’s ability to to protect and defend the N-arsenal, though its core concern is that nukes can fall in the hands of extremists. There is a broader context to the issue, which must be taken into consideration.
Toby Dalton, Co-director Carnegie Nuclear Policy Program in Washington, seems to share this view.
In  a conversation on this issue on Twitter, he said: “It is possible to  have good nuclear security practices but as a country still be insecure.  TTP resurgence and political chaos brings back fears from the last  decade. That’s the perception, I think.”
 






Pakistan is said to be plagued by a range of issues – political instability, economic crisis, and militancy. Together, these problems heighten concerns about stability in the country. In recent months, political polarisation has peaked, while the economic crisis has deepened. Even though, the country has entered an IMF programme, economic pain for the people continues to increase. In this situation, when the outside world looks at Pakistan it sees signs of trouble here.
That assessment is complicated by the reports of return of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and resurgence of terrorism and that too in the backdrop of Afghan Taliban controlling Afghanistan.
The National Security Committee’s meeting on the deteriorating situation in Swat and other parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa was, therefore, seen as the acknowledgment at the highest level of the looming crisis.
It isn’t that US has all of sudden become sensitive to these issues that have an important bearing on Pakistan’s stability; these have remained on top of foreign policy agenda related to Pakistan during the Obama era.
These apprehensions have now received a new lease of life and it is feared that President Biden’s comments would spark a fresh cycle of suspicions about nuclear security in media as well as Western capitals.

2,"Allies wanted Imran to stay on, face the music: Dar","Finance minister seeks rescheduling of repayments, won’t ask for reduction of principal debt.","WASHINGTON: In view of the country’s uncertain economic situation, some in the Pakistan Democratic Movement coalition had suggested that Imran Khan be allowed to remain in power to face the consequences of the economic crisis, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar revealed on Friday.
Late in his term, the former PM had slashed petrol prices, defying his own government’s package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which says that subsidies should only benefit the neediest as Pakistan struggles to put its finances in order.
Speaking to international news agencies during his visit to Washington, the minister said that some of his political allies had advocated letting Mr Khan stay on longer to face the music.
“It would have been selfish to have a political approach,” Dar said, justifying the need for the former PM’s removal.

Finance minister seeks rescheduling of repayments, won’t ask for reduction of principal debt

He also maintained that while the country would seek restructuring on equal terms for all bilateral creditors, when asked about possible plans seek a reduction of debt principal, he said that was not part of his agenda.
In an interview with Reuters, Mr Dar also ruled out the possibility of a default on Pakistan’s debt, an extension of the maturity date on bonds due in December or a renegotiation of Pakistan’s current International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, but would ask for the rescheduling of some $27 billion worth of non-Paris Club debt, most of which is owed to China.
“It will be our endeavor, even at the cost of extra effort, that we should complete the [IMF] programme successfully,” Dar told AFP in a separate interview.
Doing so “sends a positive signal to the international community and the markets,” he said, voicing appreciation to the “very responsive” promises of other nations for Pakistan.
He said that minor adjustments may be needed but “everything is in order” for the next review of the IMF which could release further funding.
The veteran finance minister said multilateral development banks and international donors had been “quite flexible” with ways to meet Pakistan’s external financing needs – estimated at about $32 billion after devastating floods. Some of this may come from reallocating funds from previously approved, slower-disbursing development loans, he added.
Dar, who is participating in the IMF and World Bank annual meetings just over two weeks after taking office, declined to comment when asked whether he thought it would be difficult to persuade China, creditor for about $23 billion of the debt, to participate.
While the minister is known as a staunch defender of the rupee, he said Pakistan has not engaged in physical intervention in the currency, which has been battered this year by a strong US dollar, but has rallied since his appointment. “I am for a stable currency, I am for a realistic rate. I am for market-based, but not subject to a currency being taken hostage” and making speculators billions of dollars, he said.

3,Reconstruction after floods to begin on 24th,"“It is the time for the richest people of the world to help the poorest people of Pakistan,” says Ahsan Iqbal.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif will formally announce government measures for the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase for the post-flood recovery of affected dis­tricts on Oct 24, the Planning Com­mission said on Saturday.
The announcement came after the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment of the damages and losses in the wake of catastrophic floods that hit Pakistan in August has been completed by the planning and development division in collaboration with the World Bank, ADB, EU and UN.
Addressing a roundtable on the sidelines of the World Bank-IMF annual meetings on Friday, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal shared some of the report’s key findings.
“It is the time for the richest people of the world to help the poorest people of Pakistan who are the victims of the development in the advanced world,” he said.
The UK PM’s special  representative, Nigel Casey, recalled that while international response so far has been rapid and extensive., “this crucial humanitarian aid alone will be insufficient for Pakistan’s recovery, and building back to a stronger, more resilient position must be at the forefront of our minds.”

4,Punjab gets four more districts,"BoR will be moving a summary for attaching Fort Munro with D.G. Khan, instead of Taunsa Sharif, early next week.","LAHORE: The Board of Revenue has notified four new districts — Wazirabad, Murree, Kot Addu and Talagang — out of five approved by Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, as the fifth — Taunsa Sharif — is likely to be notified next week soon after the realignment of Fort Munro tehsil that touches D.G. Khan district.
Some politicians had app­roached the provincial government demanding that Fort Munro tehsil should be attached to Dera Ghazi Khan district, which is just 30km away, while the same tehsil is more than 100km from Taunsa Sharif, sources say.
It would be relatively unfeasible for a large population to look towards Taunsa Sharif for the resolution of their problems, they had complained.
It is learnt that the BoR would be moving a summary for attaching Fort Munro with D.G. Khan, instead of Taunsa Sharif, early next week.
The Punjab government will be required to establish a complete district administrative set-up in new districts after the notification. 
Each district will have district offices of all provincial departments. Each district will also get separate budget for its functioning.
In the new local government set-up, the new districts will have district councils and it may require to amend the latest Punjab Local Government Act.
The chief minister had accorded approval to curve out five new districts, on the instructions of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, at a meeting on Thursday. 
Senior BoR member Zahid Akhtar Zaman had given a detailed briefing on new districts in Punjab at the meeting.

5,Voters’ list cut by 2.55 million as names of dead deleted,Fresh ECP count raises questions about polls held on previous lists; today’s by-elections to be held on old rolls.,"

• Fresh ECP count raises questions about polls held on previous lists
• Today’s by-elections to be held on old rolls
ISLAMABAD: Despite the registration of new voters in an exhaustive nationwide exercise carried out by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the number has dropped by no less than 2.55 million voters over the last five months. The reason: the ECP worked extra mile and found names of the dead and eventually deleted them from the rolls.
But this negligence has raised questions over the credibility of electoral rolls that were used to conduct several elections in the past.
An ECP official, when contacted, told Dawn that by-polls in eight national and three provincial assembly constituencies taking place on Sunday (today) would be held on the old voters’ lists. The new electoral rolls would be used in subsequent electoral exercises, the official added.
The total number of voters in May was 124.75m which has now slipped down to 122.19m, an analysis of the latest data and the one released in May reveals. 
While the number of male voters dropped from 68.02m to 66.40m, that of female voters decreased from 56.72m to 55.78m.
On the positive side, the gender gap between male and female voters went down from 11.30m in May to 10.61m now.
Of the 2.55m deleted names, Punjab accounts for 1.46m, followed by Sindh (0.563m), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (0.495m) and Balochistan (78,063). 
Islamabad is the only region where the number of voters increased from 0.938m to 0.984m.
Punjab alone accounts for the gap of 5.49m voters between men and women — exceeding the gap in all the other provinces put together. The gender gap in Sindh and KP comes to 2.35m and 2.05m, respectively. In Balochistan, it stands at 0.665m.
An analysis of the district-wise rolls, a copy of which is available with Dawn, shows that the number of districts having a gender gap of over 200,000 has come down from 16 in November 2021 to seven — all of which are in Punjab.
The districts out of the list of a gap of over 200,000 include Bahawalnagar, Muzaffargarh, Multan, Vehari, Okara, Bahawalpur, Sargodha and Khanewal (Punjab) and Karachi (West).
In Lahore district, the total number of registered voters stands at 6.43m, which includes 3.45m male and 2.97m female voters, translating into a gap of 0.480m. Last November, this gap was as high as 0.548m.
In Faisalabad, the gap has dropped to 0.412m from 0.448m last year. The total number of voters enrolled in the district is 5.03m, including 2.72m men and 2.31m women.
Gujranwala is next in line having a gender gap of 0.327m. The gap was 0.354m in November. The total number of voters in the district stands at 3.24m, including 1.78m males and 1.45m females.
In Rahim Yar Khan, the gap has gone down from 0.351m last year to 0.278m. The 2.88m voters in the district include 1.58m men and 1.30m women.
In Kasur district, the total number of voters has reduced from 2.17m in November last year to 0.213m now. They include 1.18m males and 0.947m females, showing a gap of 0.240m.
In Sheikhupura, the gap has come down from 0.254m in November 2021 to 0.240. The 2.13m registered voters include 1.18m males and 0.947m females.
Sialkot has 2.64m registered voters, of which 1.43m are males and 1.20m females. The gap comes to 0.226m.
In Muzaffargarh, the gender gap was 0.233m last year which has now slipped down to 0.182m. The total number of voters stands at 2.42m, including 1.30m males and 1.12m females.
Gender gap among voters in Bahawalnagar has come down from 0.229m last year to 0.195m. The total number of voters is 1.77m which includes 0.985m male and 0.790m female voters.
The gap among voters in Multan is 0.183m, Vehari (0.182m), Okara (0.180m), Bahawalpur (0.178m), Sargodha (0.176m) and Khanewal (0.157m).
In contrast, women form over 48pc of the total registered voters in five districts, including four in Punjab and one in Balochistan.
Chakwal district in Punjab has the unique distinction of having more than 49pc female voters of the total, making it a role model. The total number of registered voters in the district has slipped to from 1.19m last year to 1.16m. It includes 0.594m (50.84pc) males and 0.574m (49.16pc) females. That translates into a minor variation of 19,584 among well over a million voters.
In Jhelum district, the number of voters stands at 1.01m, including 0.524m (51.65pc) males and 0.491m (48.35pc) females.
In Rawalpindi district, the proportion of women voters is 48.20pc, in Sohbatpur (Balochistan) 48.17pc and in Attock it is 48.02pc. Other districts with high proportion of female voters include Khushab (47.83pc), Islamabad (47.36pc and Washuk (47.09pc).
