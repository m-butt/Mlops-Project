0,Private sector borrowings halve in 1QFY23,Net bank advances to the private sector plunged to Rs84 billion during July-September.,"KARACHI: Private sector being the major economic player has so far been reluctant to participate with full potential as its borrowings from banks halved year-on-year in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.
The latest data of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed that the net bank advances to the private sector plunged to Rs84 billion during July-September from Rs176.5bn in the same quarter of last year.
The conventional banks’ lending to the private sector was a record Rs971.6bn in the entire FY22 which helped the country to achieve close to 6pc economic growth rate. The current fiscal year looks more attractive for conventional banks as their lending more than doubled to Rs199.9bn in 1QFY23 from Rs94.8bn in the same quarter last year.
The high lending by the conventional banks looks against the World Bank’s prediction of up to 2pc economic growth for FY23 while it is also against the fear of high default risk due to the very high-interest rate of 15pc. Banks charge more than the policy rate, which makes borrowing costlier and risky for the private sector.
However, the Islamic bank branches of conventional banks’ were still facing net debt retirement of Rs134.3bn during the 1QFY23 against net lending of Rs54.7bn last year. This net debt retirement of the Islamic mode of financing by conventional banks also impacted the lending by full-fledged Islamic banks.
The private sector borrowings from Islamic banks declined to Rs18.5bn against Rs26.9bn in the same period last year.
The Islamic banks lent Rs239bn to the private sector in FY22 against Rs162bn in FY21.
Islamic banks made record profits during FY22, but bankers believe that the high interest rate of 15pc has increased default risks amid a slowing economy.
A recent SBP report said the assets of the Islamic banking industry (IBI) witnessed an all-time high quarterly increase of Rs836bn during April-June FY22 to reach Rs6.781 trillion. The growth in assets emanated from net investments and financing, which exhibited a quarterly rise of Rs470bn and Rs269bn, respectively.
The market share of financing of IBI in advances of the overall banking industry increased to 27.2pc from 24pc.

1,Floods spike Pakistan poverty rate: WB,"Agricultural output is expected to decline sharply, with losses to cotton, date, wheat, and rice crops.","ISLAMABAD: The World Bank says the national poverty rate in Pakistan could increase by 2.5 to 4.0 percentage points as a direct consequence of the floods, with adverse human development effects in disaster-affected areas.
The size and duration of shocks will vary across locations and households, depending on the intensity of the flooding as well as the quality of relief and reconstruction efforts, the World Bank says in its latest ‘Macro Poverty Outlook for Pakistan’ released during the course of ongoing IMF-World Bank annual meetings.
According to the outlook made available on Saturday, the high inflation and devastating floods will have an adverse impact on poverty. While rising prices reduced the real purchasing power of all households, the floods primarily affected rural areas in Sindh and Balochistan where poverty rates are already high.
Poor households are more dependent on agricultural income and spend a larger share of their income on food, and therefore will be disproportionally affected by the loss of harvest and assets like housing and livestock, and rising prices, the report notes.
The economic outlook and prospects for overdue adjustment have been significantly affected by the floods. Agricultural output is expected to decline sharply, with losses to cotton, date, wheat, and rice crops. Nearly a million livestock is estimated to have perished.
Cotton losses are expected to weigh on the domestic textile industry and the wholesale and transportation service industries. Public relief and limited reconstruction activities are expected to partially offset the loss in activity.
Real GDP growth is therefore expected to slow to 2.0 percent in the fiscal year 2023 but recover to 3.2 percent by the fiscal year 2024, supported by a recovery in agricultural production, reconstruction efforts, and projected lower global inflationary pressures.
Due to higher energy prices, flood disruptions, and the weaker rupee, inflation is projected to rise to 23.0 percent in the fiscal year 2023 but moderate over the forecast horizon with declining international energy prices and resolution of flood-related supply constraints.
Despite flood-associated effects, the current account deficit is expected to narrow slightly to 4.3 percent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023 with slower domestic economic activity and is projected to shrink further in 2024 as exports recover from flood impacts.
In line with fiscal consolidation efforts, the fiscal deficit is projected to contract modestly to 6.8 percent of GDP in FY23, despite negative revenue impacts from the flooding and increased expenditure needs. The fiscal deficit is expected to gradually narrow over the medium term as revenue mobilization measures, particularly GST harmonization and personal income tax reform, take hold.
With rapid nominal GDP growth, public debt as a share of GDP is projected to decline gradually over the forecast period, despite continued primary deficits. The macroeconomic outlook is predicated on the IMF-EFF programme remaining on track.
The outlook notes that despite an economic rebound in FY21 and fiscal year 2022, persistent structural weaknesses of the Pakistani economy, such as low productivity growth due to low investment and exports, are hindering a sustained recovery.
Expansionary Covid-related macroeconomic policies supported aggregate demand that has contributed to pressures on domestic prices, the external sector, the exchange rate, and foreign reserves. In response, the Government, amid the ongoing monetary tightening, passed a contractionary 2023 budget and reversed unsustainable energy price subsidies.
Continued policy tightening has become more challenging on account of catastrophic floods. The government will face challenges in implementing the planned fiscal consolidation, given extensive relief and recovery needs.
Additional downside risks include unexpected damages resulting from the still-evolving flooding situation that could further reduce output and worsen economic imbalances, political pressures that undermine the implementation of a coherent and prudent macroeconomic policy mix, unanticipated deterioration of external conditions, and risks associated with large fiscal and external financing needs.
The outlook emphasized that to manage these uncertainties, the government should adhere to sound economic management, while carefully targeting any new expenditures and maintaining progress on critical structural reforms, including in the energy sector.

2,Britain’s new finance minister tears up tottering PM’s agenda,LONDON: Britain’s new finance minister on Saturday warned of looming tax hikes as he admitted to  “mistakes”...,"LONDON: Britain’s new finance minister on Saturday warned of looming tax hikes as he admitted to  “mistakes” made in a disastrous budget that still threatens to bring down Prime Minister Liz Truss.
“Truss fights for survival,” The Times newspaper headlined a day after she forced chancellor of the exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng to carry the can for market turmoil sparked by their budget on Sept 23.
The Times, Telegraph and other newspapers reported that senior Conservative members of parliament were still plotting to unseat Truss, possibly within days, aghast at the party’s collapse in opinion polls since she replaced Boris Johnson on Sept 6.
New chancellor Jeremy Hunt, a former foreign secretary seen as a Tory centrist, made clear he was ripping up the strategy that brought Truss to 10 Downing Street.
“There were mistakes,” acknowledged Hunt, whom one ally called the government’s new  “chief executive” — with Truss now relegated to the role of back-seat chairwoman.
Hunt said Kwarteng and Truss had erred in trying to cut taxes for the highest earners, and in presenting their plan without independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility.
“The prime minister’s recognised that, that’s why I’m here,” Hunt told Sky News.
In one of his first acts on taking office Friday, the new chancellor spoke to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who has had to stage costly interventions to calm febrile bond markets.
Briefing reporters in Washington, Bailey said on Saturday:  “I can tell you there is a very clear and immediate meeting of minds on the importance of stability and (fiscal) sustainability.” Tax cuts were the centrepiece of the ill-starred budget announced by Kwarteng and Truss.
But they were financed through billions in extra borrowing, causing panic on financial markets at the prospect of higher inflation, which has already left British households in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis.
“We will have some very difficult decisions ahead,” Hunt said, warning that  “all government departments” face spending curbs including welfare, health and defence.
“And some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want. Some taxes will go up.” 
‘Clinging on’ 
Hunt confirmed he would deliver a new fiscal statement on October 31, agreeing on BBC radio that he had a  “clean slate” to start afresh despite Truss’s election-winning promises to rank-and-file Conservatives.
Soon after, on November 3, the Bank of England will hold its next rate-setting meeting.
In a separate speech Saturday, Bailey warned anew that the central bank would  “not hesitate” to raise rates to keep soaring inflation under control, threatening more pain for UK households and businesses after the botched budget.
Truss dismissed Kwarteng hours after he had rushed home early from international finance meetings in Washington, and she staged another U-turn in acquiescing to a significant rise in profits tax levied on companies.
At a subsequent Downing Street news conference, the prime minister took only four questions, glancing nervously around the room and delivering terse replies before abruptly leaving after just over eight minutes.
“Robotic, hesitant, tone-deaf, defiant and still utterly convinced of the purity and necessity of her mission, Liz Truss killed off her political career in a matter of minutes,” Times columnist Jenni Russell wrote.
Asked why she herself should not resign, Truss said she was  “absolutely determined to see through what I have promised” — but her comments only served to depress the pound and bond markets further.
Former Conservative leader William Hague said Truss’s premiership now  “hangs by a thread”, while ex-chancellor Philip Hammond said she had  “thrown away years and years of painstaking work” to establish the party’s record for economic competence.
But with the opposition Labour party surging in the polls, Welsh Secretary Robert Buckland warned his restive colleagues against  “throwing another prime minister to the wolves”.
Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Truss of  “clinging on”, and demanded an early general election.
“There are no historical precedents for what they have done to our economy,” he said in a speech Saturday.

3,Stocks turn red after Moody’s downgrade,"The index closed at 41,949 points, shedding 137 points or 0.3pc on a week-on-week basis.","KARACHI: The outgoing week started on the stock exchange on a positive note as investors anticipated that the policy rate would remain unchanged at 15 per cent.
Arif Habib Ltd said the momentum turned negative soon after international agency Moody’s downgraded the rating of five commercial banks while maintaining a negative outlook.
Moreover, remittances witnessed a decline of 12 per cent year-on-year in September. After appreciating against the dollar for the last two weeks, the rupee broke its winning streak. The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) reserves depleted by $303 million, reaching a three-year low of $7.6 billion. Furthermore, automobile sales plummeted 51pc year-on-year, hitting a 27-month low.
Meanwhile, a fall in government bond yields post-monetary policy statement announcement and the expectation of flood relief support from international financial institutions cushioned the overall dip.
The index closed at 41,949 points, shedding 137 points or 0.3pc on a week-on-week basis.
Sector-wise, negative contributions came from technology and communication (117 points), commercial banking (48 points), tobacco (32 points), cement (15 points) and engineering (12 points).
Whereas, sectors that contributed positively were exploration and production (46 points) and refinery (22 points).
Scrip-wise, negative contributors were TRG Pakistan Ltd (207 points), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (32 points), Meezan Bank Ltd (24 points), Engro Fertilisers Ltd (19 points) and Engro Corporation (18 points). 
Meanwhile, positive contributions came from Systems Ltd (83 points), Pakistan Oilfields Ltd (20 points), Lotte Chemical Pakistan Ltd (17 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (16 points) and Nestle Pakistan Ltd (15 points).
Foreign buying took place in the outgoing week and clocked in at $12.3m versus a net purchase of $4.7m in the preceding week. Major buying was witnessed in technology ($12.4m), power ($0.8m) and cement ($0.3m). On the local front, selling was reported by broker proprietary trading ($4.8m) and companies ($4m).
The average daily volume clocked in at 267m shares, down 39pc week-on-week. The average daily value traded settled at $44m, down 7pc from a week ago.
According to AKD Securities, the Financial Action Task Force is likely to announce its final decision regarding Pakistan in the coming week and its outcome is likely to dictate short-term sentiments.
“We advise investors to remain cautious as the near-term outlook remains hazy,” it said.

4,‘Rate hikes needed in eurozone’,"""The ECB Governing Council must not let up too soon,"" head of Germany’s Bundesbank says.","BERLIN: Higher interest rates are necessary in the eurozone, whose central bank has joined others around the world in hiking rates to cool prices, the head of Germany’s Bundesbank said Saturday.
Uncertainty about Russian energy imports is pushing the eurozone closer towards a contraction in 2023 due to high inflation, weaker global demand and falling confidence, according to some insiders in the European Central Bank (ECB).
The ECB lifted rates by a historic 0.75 percentage points at its last meeting in September to pull down eurozone consumer prices, which have hit an all-time high.
“Further interest rate hikes will be needed to bring the inflation rate back to 2 percent in the medium term -- not just at the monetary policy meeting at the end of October, in my opinion,” Joachim Nagel said in Washington, according to a release put out by Germany’s central bank.
“In any case, the ECB Governing Council must not let up too soon. Because we have to make sure that the high inflation ends,” he said.
“If inflation expectations were to de-anchor to the upside, interest rates would have to rise even faster or higher,” the chief of the central bank of the European Union’s largest economy warned.
“And the macroeconomic costs of bringing inflation back down to the desired level would be higher as well. This is a scenario that we on the ECB Governing Council absolutely want to prevent.” Inflation in the 19-nation eurozone hit a fresh high of 10 percent in September.
ECB governors hold their next monetary policy meeting on October 27, with observers expecting another jumbo rate increase of 0.75 percentage points.
The eurozone has been battered by skyrocketing energy prices ahead of winter as Russia has drastically reduced 
gas supplies to Europe in recent months, in a move seen as retaliation for Western sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine.

5,Solar industry faces equipment crunch,EPC companies are unanimous in their lament: the government has destroyed a flourishing industry.,"KARACHI: “Not a single letter of credit (LC) has been opened since the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) implemented a requirement for approval of solar equipment in early July,” says Mujtaba Raza, CEO of Solar Citizen in Karachi. “I cannot bring in new business because I do not know whether I will be able to provide the apparatus.”
Given the cost and bulk of solar panels and remaining paraphilia, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies do not normally carry large stocks of equipment.
Soaring electricity prices have generated demand amidst a tight supply crunch. Costs for solar solutions have sky-rocketed by at least 50 per cent. A 10kW system for a household, previously around Rs1-1.2m (without batteries), easily costs Rs1.5-2m if the supplier can procure the equipment.
“It has come to the point that the prices are changing daily. I negotiate with a wholesaler and agree on a price. The next day the same supplier charges a higher price. It is very difficult to give a quote to a prospective customer since we appear unprofessional if we keep changing the price,” says Mr Raza.
EPC companies are unanimous in their lament: the government has destroyed a flourishing industry.
“My company is two years old, and I went through a period in which I considered closing up shop,” says Bilal Haque, CEO of Sun Wire in Islamabad. “It used to be a good industry. However, this year it has suffered a lot of blows,” he says, listing the 17pc tax Imran Khan had imposed just before he left office and the proposed change in buyback rates by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
Loss of benefit
When the sun shines, solar panels generate electricity. Units not consumed are sold to the grid and offset by credit, reducing electricity bills. This is called net metering. For example, Ali Karimjee, a resident of DHA Karachi, generated enough credit during the summer to skip electricity bills in winter last year.
According to Nepra’s regulation, the rate at which solar credit is adjusted is the average power purchase price of around Rs10. With rising fuel prices and other challenges, the government’s average purchase price increases to Rs19, explains Musa Khan Durrani, an industry insider previously with SkyElectric.
Nepra, instead of adjusting the rate of solar credit upwards, proposes to leave it at the same or change it to the rate at which it purchases from solar power plants, he explains. And therein lies the new cost-benefit analysis.
In residential households, children go to school during the day, and the adults go to offices or run errands. Electricity consumption is minimal. But this is not true for all households, many of which are in hot cities where ACs run during the day and night.
EPC providers have differing views: one asserted that 80pc of solar energy generated by a household is consumed, so the lower net metering rate will decrease the benefit by only 5-10pc. Another argued that 70-80pc of energy produced is sold to the grid. Without a sufficient amount of net metering credits, the viability of a solar solution for a household is limited.
Case against elevated structures
The sun’s light travels millions of miles; a few additional feet of height will not make a difference, says Mr Raza, arguing against elevated structures for solar panels.
“Elevated structure from a solar company’s perspective is the easiest to install because the entire structure’s fabrication is outsourced, and the company that puts it up also installs the panels. So all my team has to do is go in and put in the wiring, and that is a job done in a day or two.”
However, he explains that an elevated structure is challenging.
The dustier the panels, the less efficient the system will be, and the less energy it will generate. In Karachi, ideally, the panels should be washed every week.
The timing of the cleaning exercise is vital as well. If the panels are washed when they are hot, they develop micro-cracks which damage them over time. Hence, it is recommended that they be washed in the morning or the evening.
“An elevated structure also has to cater for wind pressure,” adds Mr Haque. “Wind can damage the installation, and the structure may be less stable if it is not factored in.”
Elephant in the room
The SBP has not refreshed banks’ credit lines to continue the 6pc financing scheme for solar solutions. However, given the demand, some banks have launched their products for financing solar but at interest rates that range from 17.5pc to 21pc or higher.
However, financing is not the challenge at hand since some have ready cash. While the higher rates of solar paraphernalia have increased the payback period to four to five years (from three to four years previously), rising electricity prices continue to make solar an attractive investment. But the elephant in the room is the supply crunch of solar equipment, without which all cost-benefit analyses are mere words.
