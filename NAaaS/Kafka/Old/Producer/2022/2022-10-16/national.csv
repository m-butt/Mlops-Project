0,Biden’s quip ‘won’t help US cause’,White House press secretary says secure and prosperous Pakistan is critical to US interests.,"WASHINGTON: The White House assured Pakistan on Saturday that President Joe Biden supports a strong and prosperous Pakistan, hours after the US leader stirred a storm by calling the South Asian nuclear nation a dangerous nation.
“The president views a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests,” said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre when asked to comment on Mr Biden’s remarks.
But others were not convinced this latest outburst will help Washington win over any ‘hearts and minds’ in the country that is already witnessing a wave of anti-US sentiment, championed by former PM Imran Khan.
“Strange comment - not the type of thing senior US officials typically say publicly as much as they used to,” said Michael Kugelman, a Pakistan scholar at the Wilson Center, Washington.
Mr Kugelman said he did not know what prompted Mr Biden’s remarks, was but he likely received intel briefs that referred to Pakistan’s churn-bad political polarization, an economic crisis, and resurgent terror. “That, combined with legacy concerns about nukes, may have  prompted the comment.”
He said President Biden’s  reference to “without any cohesion” was apparently a comment on “current trends playing out in Pakistan more broadly right now, and not  to nuclear issues per se.”
The comments, he said, “certainly won’t help improve Pakistani public perceptions of the US,  but I doubt it’ll impact bilateral relations in a big way.”
Commenting on Islamabad’s decision to summon the US ambas­sador, he said:  “This is where finally having a formal ambassador back in Islamabad  will help.”
He noted that “reaction from Pak officials has also been fairly conciliatory.”
Prof Hassan Abbas of the US National Defence University said to him “Biden’s statement appears to be a slip of the tongue.”
President Biden, he said, was not talking about any weakness in the  nuclear command and control in Pakistan as the country has indeed  developed a strong system over the last decade or so.“
The US president was “likely hinting at cohesion in the political sphere in Pakistan, given political instability and rising polarisation,” Prof Abbas said. “The increasing use of anti-US rhetoric in PTI political rallies are concerning for Washington,” he added.
Tamanna Salikuddin of the US Institute of Peace, another US think-tank, said President Biden’s remarks were not an official statement nor a change of policy towards Pakistan.
Pointing out that the remarks were made amongst a discussion of global threats, including China and Russia, she said: “His words reflect the underlying US national security concerns regarding Pakistan’s nuclear security amidst continued political and economic instability and terrorist attacks from groups such as TTP.”
Despite improvements and commitments to nuclear security in Pakistan, “lack of stability in other sectors continues to worry US policymakers, especially with the persistent risk of escalation between India and Pakistan,” Ms Salikuddin said.
She, however, acknowledged that the remarks came at an unfortunate moment, when there were improvements in the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship.
She warned that President Biden’s statements will feed into the anti-Americanism “that is politically very popular right now in Pakistan.”

1,Politicians across party lines call on Biden to apologise,Ex-PMs Nawaz and Imran say Islamabad has ‘most secure command and control system’...,"ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Former prime ministers Na­­waz Sharif and Imran Khan and senior politicians lash­­ed out at US President Joe Biden after he called Pakis­tan one of the “most da­­ngerous nations in the wor­­ld” for having “nuclear wea­pons without any cohesion” and asked him to apologise for his baseless remarks.
In a tweet, the PML-N supremo said, “Pakistan is a responsible nuclear state that is perfectly capable of safeguarding its national interest whilst respecting international law and practices. Our nuclear program is in no way a threat to any country.”


Nawaz Sharif

 
“Like all independent states, Pakistan reserves the right to protect its autonomy, sovereign statehood and territorial integrity,” the three-time premier said in response to a statement made by President Biden on the nuclear arsenal of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, PTI chairman and former premier Imran Khan blamed the PML-N for the remarks made by Mr Biden and said the ruling party “compromised the national security” of Pakistan. He said the US president’s remarks reflected the failure of the Pakistan government’s claims of a “reset” in relations with the US.

Ex-PMs Nawaz and Imran say Islamabad has ‘most secure command and control system’

“On what info has @POTUS reached this unwarranted conclusion on our nuclear capability when, having been PM, I know we have one of the most secure nuclear command & control systems? 2. Unlike the US which has been involved in wars across the world, when has Pakistan shown aggression [especially] post-nuclearisation?
“This govt has broken all records for incompetence My greatest worry is that apart from leading us to economic ruin &, with NRO2 for themselves, giving a licence to white-collar criminals to plunder the country, this govt will also end up completely compromising our national security.”
“Pakistan’s record as a responsible nuclear power is unimpeachable and internationally attested to,” said Defence Minister Khawaja Asif in a tweet.


Imran Khan

 
“We have also historically provided military assistance to the very armed forces whose commander in chief erroneously questions our ‘cohesion’” he said.
PTI blames ‘imported govt’ 
Meanwhile, the PTI leaders also came down hard on the US president and asked him to apologise. PTI leader Asad Umar stated: “Nuclear country without cohesion? Is Biden referring to the US?”
Fawad Chaudhry also blamed the incumbent 
government for the Mr Biden’s remarks. He added, “Biden’s statement is actually proof that the PTI government was dislodged through conspiracy becau­­se the US President would not have dared to make this statement while Imran Khan was in the office,” he said. 
PTI Central Senior Vice President Dr Shireen Mazari questioned the alleged silence of the federal government and the Pakistan Army’s spokesperson and termed it shameful. 
“You need to apologise to the Pakistani nation for your nasty remarks just because your regime change conspiracy is faltering,” Ms Mazari said. 


Khursheed Shah

 
She added: “Irrespon­sible superpower with nukes and your proclivity to interfere globally with regime change agendas alongside militarising the oceans. Custodial torture in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, Bagram. Even your own people are not safe with gunmen going on killing sprees. Have some shame Biden”.
Meanwhile, PPP leader and cabinet minister Khursheed Shah said the statement was an alleged proof of “mistrust” concerning the Muslim community living across the globe.
He alleged that Imran Khan was brought into Pakistan on the agenda of foreign forces who wanted to deprive Pakistan of its nuclear capacity.

2,Govt leaves oil prices unchanged on by-polls’ eve,ISLAMABAD : The government on Saturday decided to keep the prices of petroleum products unchanged for the next...,"ISLAMABAD : The government on Saturday decided to keep the prices of petroleum products unchanged for the next fortnight, effective from Oct 16, a move seen as ‘an attempt to woo voters’ a day before crucial by-elections on 11 constituencies. 
In a video statement issued from Washington DC, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said a summary was moved by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and after consultation with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the decision has been made to keep prices the same till October 31.
The per litre price of petrol will remain at Rs224.80, high speed diesel (HSD) at Rs235.30, kerosene at Rs191 and light diesel oil (LDO) at Rs186.50.
The Ogra’s summary had requested a minor reduction in the price of petrol, and an increase in prices of diesel, kerosene and LDO
According to industry officials, the price of petrol has reduced by around Rs10 per litre in the international market during the last fortnight. In the meantime, the average rate of US dollar had also come down from Rs 235.95 to Rs 222.13.
The exchange range impact has been worked out to Rs13.82 per litre.
Earlier, the government had cut the price of petrol by Rs12.63 on Oct 1.
Analysts have called the move an attempt to placate voters before by-polls on 11 National and Punjab As­­s­e­mbly seats on Sunday (today). Infla­tion will be a huge factor for the voters who have been burdened due to rising petrol prices and hefty power bills, according to analysts.

3,Fines will recoup banks’ profits from dollar speculation: Miftah,"Former finance minister claims army helped broker deals with US, Gulf countries.","KARACHI:  Former finance minister Miftah Ismail has admitted that some commercial  banks made hefty profits between May and July — when the US dollar was  gaining value against the rupee, but was confident that the  government’s plan to impose hefty fines on them will offset those profits.
Mr  Ismail, whose candid remarks have been making headlines since he was replaced last month, appeared on a podcast where he claimed that  the monetary help extended by Gulf countries comes on the back of  “Pakistan Army’s strategic support” to those nations.
Commenting on the rupee’s value — which has gained 8.25 per cent after Mr Ismail  was replaced by Ishaq Dar — the former finance minister categorically  denied the perception that this was being done artificially.

Former finance minister claims army helped broker deals with US, Gulf countries

Talking to Shehzad Ghias Shaikh on ‘The Pakistan Experience’, he explained the government had no method to intervene in the market “by pumping dollars”.
He  remarked that Mr Dar has been saying that the actual value of the   dollar was around Rs200 and therefore, the exporters were thinking  that  its value will fall and they are selling it which strengthened the rupee.
However, he  claimed  around eight commercial banks made profit through speculation  while  assuring the SBP that they were making a loss
“The National  Bank  of Pakistan sold dollars to Pakistan State Oil at the rate of  Rs242 the  day when the market closed at Rs230,” he said, while  explaining the role  of the banks in currency speculation.
Army’s role in politics
Mr  Ismail also claimed that Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa called US Deputy  Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to facilitate the IMF deal. However, he  added that many economic deals in the past were also brokered with the  army’s help.
The deal with Qatar during the Imran Khan-led  government to buy LNG at 10.4per cent of Brent was brokered by General  Bajwa, he claimed.
“The fact of the matter is that [the] army has a  lot of ingress in  Pakistan politics. There is no debate about it,” he  said, adding that  Pakistan was one of the countries where the army has a  huge role in  politics.
“The money [Pakistan] gets from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar doesn’t come without the army’s support,” he said.
He also criticised PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s crusade against  corruption adding that many countries are more corrupt than Pakistan but  yet they were progressing.
“NAB has been there for so long. Since  NAB [was established] corruption has increased or decreased? There are  also PPRA rules. You have created so many inefficiencies that Pakistan  is now almost a dysfunctional state which does not work for the people.”

4,Swati’s remand in ‘mutiny’ case extended till today,PML-N leader moves IHC against Aitzaz for contempt...,"ISLAMABAD: A local court on Saturday extended the physical remand of Senator Azam Swati in a case registered against him over a controversial tweet against the military establishment  denouncing the acquittal of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his son in a multi-billion money laundering case.
Judicial magistrate Mohammad Shabbir Bhatti handed over his custody to FIA’s Cybercrime Wing for another day with the direction to produce him in the court on Oct 16.
The FIA produced the senator before the court and sought his physical remand for eight more days, as special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that the investigation agency had yet to make recoveries from the senator.
Mr Abbasi said Mr Swati tweeted ‘objectionable and defamatory’ content through his verified twitter handle. He argued that the court could hand over his custody on physical remand for 14 days. The PTI leader was continuously uploading such material on social media in which he accused the chief of army staff for ‘facilitating criminals’, he added.

PML-N leader moves IHC against Aitzaz for contempt

He told the court that the senator admitted he had tweeted the objectionable content, but the prosecution sought to recover his mobile phone to ascertain as to whether he acted on his own or this was part of an organised and coordinated attempt to malign the army and the judiciary. Mr Swati told the court that he had thrown his mobile phone out of home instead of giving it to the FIA as it contained family photos.
Defence counsel Babar Awan argued there was no need to extend physical remand after Mr Swati’s confession. “What is the investigation officer trying to establish now? Was Imran Khan behind this tweet or it was done on behest of US President Joe Biden,” he argued. “Does he want to go to the US to verify the twitter account?” he remarked.
While claiming that he could play several videos in the courtroom showing other some leaders criticising the military establishment even more harshly, Mr Awan said that the senator was tortured in custody and some unidentified people were trying to stop doctors from writing factual medical report of his client. “If the court permits, Mr Swati can show the marks of torture and wounds,” he added.
In a harshly-worded tweet, PTI Senator Swati had sarcastically congratulated the army chief “Mr Bajwa” and a few others, saying “Your plan is really working and all criminals are getting free at cost of this country” and alleging corruption had been “legitimised”.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) arrested him on Thursday after booking him on charges of inciting mutiny. The FIR was registered under Sections 131 (abetting mutiny), 500 (defamation), 501 (printing defamatory contents), 505 (conducing public mischief), and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 20 of Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
Contempt petition against Aitzaz 
Also, PML-N leader Mohammad Safdar filed a petition in Islamabad High Court seeking contempt proceedings against former PPP senator Aitzaz Ahsan over his remarks that the military establishment manipulated the acquittal of the Sharif family.
Besides Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shahbaz, the petitioner and his spouse Maryam Nawaz were recently acquitted in the Avenfield reference.
Mr Ahsan had alleged the “establishment” helped the Sharif family get clear of the cases of corruption against them. Mr Safdar said the Supreme Court convicted PML-N leaders Talal Chaudhry and Daniyal Aziz for ‘merely criticising the judiciary’. He requested similar treatment for Mr Ahsan as he requested the court to initiate contempt proceedings against him, citing the ex-senator and advocate general for Islamabad as respondents.

9,Pakistan suffered climate-induced losses worth $29bn: World Bank,"Projected temperature extremes will progressively amplify negative impacts, says report.","ISLAMABAD: Weather- and climate-related disasters have affected over 75 million Pakistanis in the past three decades, with estimated economic losses of over $29 billion, or roughly $1billion a year, latest World Bank report estimated.
The projected temperature extremes will progressively amplify the negative impacts on human health, livelihoods, and ecosystems that Pakistan is already experiencing, said the report titled “From Swimming in Sand to High and Sustainable Growth: A Roadmap to Reduce Distortions in the Allocation of Resources and Talent in the Pakistani Economy”.
The report explained Pakistan’s climate has been changing in recent decades and the country faced rates of warming that are considerably above the global average. 
From 1999 to 2002, droughts in Sindh and Balochistan provinces killed two million livestock and required emergency relief to provide drinking water and food to farming communities. Even minimal changes in precipitation patterns over prolonged periods can alter Pakistan’s food production by placing greater pressure on the water resources that the country’s irrigation network depends on.
Except for the northern mountainous region, projected yield declines are widespread, particularly for crops such as cotton, wheat, sugarcane, maize, and rice. 
Since 1993, crop yields in Pakistan have increased 78pc.
From a geographical point of view, this increase in yields was driven by increases in Punjab and Sindh, which increased their yields by 95pc and 87pc, respectively. Conversely, yields in KP only increased by 27pc, while those in Balochistan fell by 13pc.
All provinces heavily increased the use of capital like tractors, tube wells, threshers and fertilizer per hectare, while all provinces other than Punjab also increased the amount of labour used per land at a rate higher than yield growth, implying that the increase in yields by hectare was mainly driven by more intensive use of productive inputs rather than by an increase in productivity, the report notes.
Crop district-level analysis of total factor productivity (TFP) revealed a generalised contraction in agriculture TFP in Pakistan, accentuated since the turn of the century. Aggregating the crop district level results at the national level shows that TFP declined at an annual average rate of minus 1.2pc. The decline in TFP is explained by performance deterioration since the turn of the century. 
Between 1993 and 1998, the TFP for crops grew by 21pc, or an average 3.9pc per year. Since then, TFP has been contracting at an average rate of 2.3pc per year.
Highly diverse regional performance indicates that Punjab and Sindh experienced increases in TFP, but KP and Balochistan experienced large TFP declines. Within Punjab, all agro-climatic zones increased TFP except for the Barani zone, while in Sindh, growth was driven by the cotton-wheat growing areas.
Farm-level analysis of productivity in Punjab also reveals a contraction in the average productivity in wheat, rice and cotton farms, while it shows an increase in sugarcane farms. The results obtained from a systematic analysis of farm-level data in Punjab between 2013 and 2019 show that the simple average TFP across farms declined in wheat, rice, and cotton farms, but increased in the case of sugarcane farms.
The drivers of aggregate productivity growth can shed some light on the extent of misallocation of resources in crop agriculture in Punjab.

The federal government on Saturday authorised deployment of two companies of the FC on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s request to avert any untoward incident, as the TLP had announced that a procession to be led by its chief Saad Rizvi from Haripur towards Havelian in the adjacent Abbottabad district.
The KP home department had sent a letter to the interior secretary on Oct 12, requesting for deployment of armed forces in Haripur and Abbottabad districts fearing unrest due to the ‘illegal’ procession.
The provincial government, in its letter, stated the ‘illegal’ procession on Sunday in Havelian was likely to disrupt the peace in the region. There is a likelihood of sectarian clash or confrontation, as Havelian has heavy presence of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamat supporters who had already announced resistance to any such procession.
In an order issued on Saturday, the Ministry of Interior authorised deployment of two companies of the FC, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as Quick Response Force in standby mode only under the Anti- Terrorism Act for security duties.

12,Shehbaz holds PTI responsible for people’s hardships,Says Imran wants Pakistan to default.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday held the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government responsible for the economic difficulties of the common man and expressed determination to take the country out of economic hardship. 
Addressing a conference, he said the PTI government violated the agreement with the International Monetary Fund to create difficult economic situation for the succeeding coalition government. 
The conference was organised by Jamiat  Ulema-i-Islam-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, in memory of his father and former chief minister of  erstwhile NWFP Mufti Mehmood. 
PM Sharif said when his coalition partners gave him responsibility to lead the country, the economy was in dire straits and the country was on the verge of default. 

Says Imran wants Pakistan to default

Referring to former PM Imran Khan, he said that he wanted Pakistan to default and become another Sri Lanka. 
He said under the guidance of Nawaz Sharif and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the coalition government went through a difficult time. However, he added, it succeeded in taking steps for the progress of Pakistan.
“If our intentions are good, [and] we fear Allah, then Allah removes all difficulties and opens new paths.” 
The premier said he never wanted to put burden of inflation on people and after the return of Ishaq Daq, the government had managed to reduce the petrol prices. 
He said the government, with support of coalition partners, would consider further reduction in petrol prices. 
Pakistan did not come into being to remain poor but to become prosperous and emerge as a dignified country, he remarked. 
He said it was unfortunate that abuse of opponents had become rampant in today’s politics.  
The prime minister said he did not come across a liar bigger than Imran Khan. He [Imran Khan] is telling lies day and night and is constantly hatching conspiracies against the nation and institutions, the PM.
